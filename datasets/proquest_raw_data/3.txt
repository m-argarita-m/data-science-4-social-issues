Full text: New program to invest up to $500 million for single-family rentals
CHICAGO, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- JLL Income Property Trust, an institutionally managed daily NAV REIT (NASDAQ: ZIPTAX; ZIPTMX; ZIPIAX; ZIPIMX) with more than $7.2 billion in total assets, announced today it has expanded its existing relationship with Amherst, a vertically integrated real estate investment, development and operating platform, to acquire up to $500 million in single-family rental homes in a phased venture over the next two years. JLL Income Property Trust will have a 95% ownership in the venture, and Amherst will have a 5% stake. JLL Income Property Trust previously acquired a 47% interest in a 4,000-home portfolio in which Amherst is also a partner and the operator.
The initial closing of this expanded program includes approximately 360 recently acquired and fully renovated single-family rental homes diversified across 10 states and 16 geographically distinct markets, valued at approximately $120 million. These locations align well to LaSalle Research & Strategy's top ranked single-family rental markets and share attractive investment characteristics such as strong population and job growth, favorable demographic trends along with limited new supply of single-family homes.
"Single-family rental homes are one of our highest conviction property sectors given numerous tailwinds that should provide resilient demand and the potential for attractive rent growth within this carefully selected portfolio," said Allan Swaringen, President & CEO of JLL Income Property Trust. "Home mortgage rates are at 20-year highs, making homeownership less affordable while at the same time remote or hybrid work is becoming a staple in the workplace. Post-pandemic, a growing age cohort of Millennials are seeking more spacious living arrangements than they can find in cities or in the traditional suburban apartment communities and single-family home rentals provide an attractive alternative living situation. There remains a deep shortage in new home construction compared to demand due to elevated construction costs, higher interest rates and lingering supply chain disruptions. Providing high-quality, affordable single-family homes for rent in areas with good schools and safe neighborhoods, where families might not otherwise be able to buy, is a strong value proposition for tenants, these communities, and our investors."
Swaringen added, "This transaction continues to grow JLL Income Property Trust's allocation to residential properties, a top performing sector, and one of the more inflation resistant. Well-leased, stabilized and geographically diversified investments such as single-family rentals ideally provide a unique combination of defensive characteristics, especially amid current market volatility and economic uncertainty, while also delivering future growth potential. We are thrilled to expand our relationship with Amherst, a firm widely regarded as a best-in-class operator of single-family rental properties."
"We are excited to be expanding our successful partnership with JLL Income Property Trust," said Chris Avallone, Head of Capital Management at Amherst. "With increasing barriers to homeownership and U.S. housing supply at historic lows, we are as committed as ever to revitalizing America's aging housing stock and providing growing families the choice of a high-quality home in communities of opportunity. This strategic partnership further enables us to deepen this commitment to the residents and investors we serve," added Avallone.
The transaction is initially being completed unlevered, with a target of deploying capital in tranches up to a total of $500 million across multiple geographies. JLL Income Property Trust's residential allocation now totals approximately $3 billion and encompasses nearly 10,600 units. More broadly, over 80% of the portfolio is invested in the residential, industrial and healthcare sectors, which have historically been seen to combat inflation and to be defensive and resilient in the face of broader economic uncertainties.
JLL Income Property Trust is an institutionally managed, daily NAV REIT that brings to investors a growing portfolio of commercial real estate investments selected by an institutional investment management team and sponsored by one of the world's leading real estate services firms.
About JLL Income Property Trust, Inc.  (NASDAQ: ZIPTAX; ZIPTMX; ZIPIAX; ZIPIMX), 
JLL Income Property Trust, Inc. is a daily NAV REIT that owns and manages a diversified portfolio of high quality, income-producing residential, industrial, grocery-anchored retail, healthcare and office properties located in the United States.

Full text: Evvr's in-wall, multi-protocol smart home hub earns the Consumer Technology Association's highest honor prior to the CES conference in Las Vegas in January.
LAS VEGAS, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Evvr, a provider of intelligent automation tools for homes and businesses, announced today their receipt of a Consumer Technology Association (CES) Innovation Award for their Evvr Hub smart home controller.

An innovative program to anchor technician training to broaden and strengthen the talent pipeline
CHASKA, Minn. and HANOVER, Md., Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- TEL Manufacturing and Engineering of America, a leader in the development, manufacturing, and sales of surface preparation systems and gas cluster ion beam (GCIB) technologies for diverse semiconductor applications, and NIIT, the nation's leader in the semiconductor talent pipeline development, announced the establishment of a new Registered Apprenticeship Program (RAP), developed to help TEL Manufacturing and Engineering of America's Chaska, MN facility attract, train, and retain a highly talented, skilled, and diverse technician workforce.
This program is part of NIIT's "Growing Apprenticeships in Nanotechnology and Semiconductors" (GAINS) program, a RAP designed to meet the semiconductor industry's future workforce needs. The innovative, competency-based program will leverage NIIT's National Talent Hub. This state-of-the-art portal was created with the support of the National Science Foundation to be a single, national infrastructure to identify individuals, assess and align skills, and target training to meet program requirements. 
The new GAINS program leverages a collaborative approach in which other regional partners are engaged to help deploy the program. In Chaska, those partners include Hennepin Technical College and the Minnesota Department of Labor.
NIIT has the exclusive U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) contract to lead the expansion of the nation's RAPs throughout semiconductor and nanotechnology-related industries. The TMEA GAINS program, one of the most innovative USDOL programs for advanced manufacturing, devised to support any U.S. TEL site, can be expanded to include entry engineers and provide a pathway for GAINS pre-apprenticeship programs.
"We appreciate the support of NIIT, Hennepin Technical College, and the Minnesota Department of Labor in establishing the GAINS Registered Apprenticeship Program here at our Chaska facility. With the help of NIIT and regional partners, we will be able to offer not only promising careers but efficient training that will benefit the individual and help make TEL Manufacturing and Engineering of America more competitive", said Mark Dougherty, President of TEL Manufacturing and Engineering of America
"We are excited to support TEL Manufacturing and Engineering of America and TEL US in meeting their workforce requirements. NIIT is uniquely qualified with existing infrastructure and programs as well as industry and apprenticeship expertise specifically designed to meet the needs of the semiconductor industry, and we look forward to bringing it to bear to support TEL Manufacturing and Engineering of America", said Mike Russo, President, and CEO of NIIT.
"Hennepin Technical College is excited to partner with TEL Manufacturing and Engineering of America and NIIT on the GAINS Registered Apprenticeship Program. With the current difficulties of finding highly skilled workers, companies need to develop new strategies for finding and retaining these workers. By developing an Apprenticeship pathway, TEL Manufacturing and Engineering of America is showing innovation in gaining these employees and taking steps to secure their future workforce. This pathway will lead to a successful career for the apprentices and help to provide a stable and quality workforce for TEL Manufacturing and Engineering of America" said Jeff Thorstad, Faculty of Automation Robotics Engineering Technologies/Packaging at Hennepin Technical College.
"We believe registered apprenticeship programs are a solid path for workers to establish career opportunities and for employers to build a motivated, highly skilled workforce," said Nicole Blissenbach, DLI temporary commissioner. "These types of programs help build our state's workforce and continue to strengthen our economy."
About NIIT NIIT   is a 501(c)(3) with a mission to identify roadblocks to innovation in strategic industry sectors – those important to the nation's security and global competitiveness - and ensure they are eliminated.

While the floor of the LA Auto Show exhibits future designs that aren't yet off the assembly line, eBay Motors will show the amazing things that can be done using vehicles on the road today. Four of the vehicles will be available for purchase, including:
- 1969 Ford F100 Ranger "Ranch Relic" | Mike Satterfield of @TheGentlemanRacer – Satterfield's 1969 Ford F100 Ranger is an authentic ranch truck marked with true patina, including light rust and dings. The exterior updates include an old hickory bed inset and gorgeous work truck lettering to bring the aesthetic to life.


- 2010 Dodge Challenger R/T "1000 HP Budget Build" | Christina Roki of @ChristinaRoki – Christina built her Dodge Challenger R/T to punch above its weight at the drag strip with the iconic Hellcat Redeye engine. Coated in a copper chrome wrap, the combination of performance and style turns heads on and off the track.


- 2020 Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 "Poor-ish GT4" | LeeC Parts of @ScrapLifeGarage – This Porsche Cayman GT4 spent its early life as a race track machine before being totaled in an unfortunate accident on the street. Purchased during a salvage auction and rebuilt with manufacturer-spec parts and accessories found on eBay Motors, it's back in action - complete with track-appropriate livery.


- 2012 Audi R8 Twin-Turbo "Super-Kart" | LeeC Parts of @ScrapLifeGarage – The crew at LeeC Parts love crazy, track-ready racing machines. This Audi R8 Twin-Turbo has been modified to look, ride and race like an oversized go-kart complete with 1,500 horsepower.

Bidding is now open at ebay.com/PartsofAmericaAuction and runs through 4 p.m. PT, Saturday, Nov. 26.

Full text: LE AD PLAINTIFF DEADLINE IS JANUARY 9, 2023
NEW YORK, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- November 16, 2022 -  Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz LLP announces that a federal securities class action has been filed against Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Eiger" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: EIGR) and certain of its officers, on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased, or otherwise acquired Eiger securities between March 10, 2021 and October 4, 2022, both dates inclusive (the "Class Period").
A ll investors who purchased the shares and incurred losses are advised to contact the firm immediately at classmember@whafh.com or (800) 575-0735 or (212) 545-4774. You may obtain additional information concerning the action or join the case on our website, www.whafh.com.
If you have incurred losses, you may, no later than January 9, 2023 , request that the Court appoint you lead plaintiff of the proposed class. Please contact Wolf Haldenstein to learn more about your rights.
PLEASE CLICK HERE TO JOIN THE CASE
The filed Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made/materially false and misleading statements, and failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operational, and compliance policies.
Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose to investors that:
- Defendants overstated Eiger's clinical and regulatory drug development expertise;
- Defendants failed to properly assess, and/or ignored issues with, the design of the TOGETHER study and its ability to support the peginterferon lambda EAU;
- there were issues with the conduct of the TOGETHER study and/or the TOGETHER study was not properly designed for the peginterferon lambda EUA in the current context of the pandemic;
- as a result, the FDA was unlikely to approve the submission of a peginterferon lambda EUA;
- as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On September 6, 2022, Eiger issued a press release "provid[ing] an update on the status of its planned request for [EUA] of peginterferon lambda for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 based on its most recent communications with the [FDA]." Specifically, the Company announced that "[f]ollowing a cooperative and extensive pre-EUA information exchange with [the] FDA regarding the Phase 3 TOGETHER study of peginterferon lambda for COVID-19, the agency has indicated that it is not yet able to determine whether the criteria for the submission of an application and issuance of an EUA are likely to be met."
On this news, Eiger's stock price fell $2.51 per share, or 29.36%, to close at $6.04 per share on September 6, 2022.
Subsequently, on October 5, 2022, Eiger announced that it would not seek an EUA request for peginterferon lambda after the FDA had "denied the request for a pre-EUA meeting." The Company disclosed that, "[c]iting its concerns about the conduct of the TOGETHER study, [the] FDA concluded that any authorization request based on the[] data [presented] is unlikely to meet the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA in the current context of the pandemic."
On this news, Eiger's stock price fell $0.37 per share, or 5.01%, to close at $7.02 per share on October 5, 2022.

NEW YORK , Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --  Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz LLP announces that a federal securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of investors who  Rent the Runway, Inc. ("RTR") (NASDAQ:RENT) who purchased Class A common stock issued in connection with RTR's October 2021 initial public offering (the "IPO").
A ll investors who purchased the shares and incurred losses are advised to contact the firm immediately at classmember@whafh.com or (800) 575-0735 or (212) 545-4774. You may obtain additional information concerning the action or join the case on our website, www.whafh.com.
If you have incurred losses, you may, no later than January 13, 2023 , request that the Court appoint you lead plaintiff of the proposed class. Please contact Wolf Haldenstein to learn more about your rights.
PLEASE CLICK HERE TO JOIN THE CASE
RTR is an e-commerce platform that allows users to rent, subscribe, or buy designer apparel and accessories. RTR offers high-end apparel such as evening wear and accessories, as well as more causal and mixed-use items.
On October 4, 2021, RTR filed an SEC registration statement on a FormS-1 for the IPO, which, after several amendments, was declared effective on October 26, 2021 (the "Registration Statement"). On October 27, 2021, RTR filed a prospectus for the IPO on a Form 424B4, which incorporated and formed part of the Registration Statement (the "Prospectus"). 17 million shares of RTR Class A common stock at $21 per share for $357 million were sold to investors.
According to the filed complaint, RTR failed to disclose in its Registration Statement and Prospectus the following adverse facts that existed at the time of the IPO:
- RTR was continuing to face extraordinary business head winds, such as transportation headwinds and labor wage rate increases, from the COVID-19 pandemic;
- RTR's active subscriber enrollments had sharply decelerated from the growth trajectory represented in the Registration Statement and, as a result, RTR was several months away from approaching its pre-pandemic levels of active subscriptions;
- RTR needed to substantially increase marketing and advertising costs from historical figures in order to attempt to grow its active subscriber network;
- RTR was suffering from ballooning fulfillment and transportation costs; and
- as a result of the above, RTR was suffering accelerating operational losses at the time of the IPO and was far less likely to achieve profitability in the near term, if ever, than originally represented.

RTR's stock is currently trading at $1.60 per share, or over 90% below the IPO price.

NEW YORK, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --  Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz LLP   announces that a federal securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the District of  Maryland on behalf of investors who acquired Enviva Inc.

On October 12, 2022, before market hours, Blue Orca published a report which alleged, among other things, that "new discovered data suggests . . . the company is flagrantly greenwashing its wood procurement" and characterized Enviva's claim to be a "pure play ESG Company with a healthy, self-funded dividend and cash flows to provide a platform for future growth" as "nonsense on all counts." The report further alleged that " Enviva is a dangerously levered serial capital raiser whose deteriorating cash conversion and unprofitability will drain it of cash next year" and is "a product of deranged European climate subsidies which incentivize the destruction of American forests so that European power companies can check a bureaucratic box."
On this news, Enviva's stock fell $7.74, or 13.1%, to close at $51.23 per share on October 12, 2022.

Full text: LONDON, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pure IP announced today the launch of its eVoc2 partner program, aimed specifically at U.S.-based Managed Service Providers (MSP) and Telcos, enabling them to offer their end customers business telephony services with Microsoft Teams using Operator Connect. The program is in support of Microsoft's drive to scale up the growth and enablement and adoption of Teams for voice.
The Pure IP eVoc2 program – Electronically enabling Voice with Operator Connect through the power of 2 – is designed to help partners capitalize on the Teams potential and provide their clients with the way of capitalizing on the organizational benefits of cloud telephony. There are two models available, one designed for Telcos who have their own billing and delivery infrastructure, and the other for MSPs.
The program combines access to Pure IP's trusted and resilient cloud-based global voice network, with online automated tools for quick and easy provisioning and ordering, and a suite of support services for partners to seamlessly enable their customers with Teams voice.
Speaking about the program, Gary Forrest, CEO at Pure IP said, "Events over the past two years have understandably accelerated the migration to cloud-based services, particularly in unified enterprise communications and collaboration. This represents a huge opportunity and a threat to incumbent providers in a dynamically changing market."
He continues: "We are excited to work with Microsoft on this latest initiative and believe that our eVoc2 program offers service providers a cost-effective method of retaining and growing their business by helping their customers optimize the benefits of cloud telephony. Our eVoc2 program combines our global footprint with our automated provisioning and ordering tools backed by people. The automation provides the speed and efficiency, but it is important to back that up with knowledgeable people to support our partners and their customers. We pride ourselves on not being a faceless organization."
eVoc2 utilizes Operator Connect for the delivery of voice services in Teams. Operator Connect was launched in 2021 by Microsoft with Pure IP as one of the original launch partners, working alongside Microsoft throughout the development and go-live phases. Operator Connect is fast becoming the method of choice for businesses wanting to light up external voice services in Teams, allowing them to combine third-party carrier services with the simplicity of managing services via their Microsoft 365 Admin Center.
Commenting on becoming an Operator Connect partner, Gary Forrest states, "With eVoc2 we circumnavigate the need to for partners to become accredited in their own rights, fast-tracking them to be able to offer Operator Connect as an option for their customers."
Christopher Martini, Global Partner Solutions U.S. for Modern Work at Microsoft added, "The growth of Microsoft Teams as a platform is well documented and end customers are continuing to see the benefits of deepening their use of the platform. For providers and delivery partners this represents a challenge and an opportunity in keeping pace with the change to continue meeting the customers need. Working with partners like Pure IP and their eVoc2 program will help them unlock the Teams voice potential and satisfy the customer demand. Pure IP have been a part of the Operator Connect program from the start, and we are excited to have them onboard with this new initiative."
In addition to the core voice services, partners to the eVoc2 program can also benefit from access to Pure IP's portfolio of other services including cloud enablement, legacy integration, SBCaaS and more.

Full text: HAMILTON, Bermuda, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Höegh LNG Partners LP (NYSE: HMLP-PA) (the "Partnership") today reported its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.
Highlights
- Reported for the third quarter of 2022 total time charter revenues of $36.9 million (Q3 2021: $35.6 million).
- Generated for the third quarter of 2022 operating income of $18.2 million (Q3 2021: $27.1 million), net income of $16.6 million (Q3 2021: $17.4 million) and limited partners' interest in net income of $12.7 million (Q3 2021: $13.5 million).
- Reported equity in earnings of joint ventures for the third quarter of 2022 of $2.5 million (Q3 2021: $6.1 million) which includes two 50% owned FSRUs, the Neptune and the Cape Ann . During the third quarter of 2022, the Neptune completed a class renewal which impacted the equity in earnings due to certain expenses incurred which were not reimbursed by the charterer and due to the yard stay exceeding the contractual allowance which resulted in reduced charter hire for the off-hire period.
- On September 23, 2022 (the "Effective Time"), Höegh LNG Holdings Ltd. ("Höegh LNG") completed its acquisition of the Partnership's publicly held common units pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of May 25, 2022 (the "Merger Agreement"). Under the Merger Agreement Höegh LNG acquired, for cash, all of the outstanding publicly held common units of the Partnership, at a price of $9.25 per common unit for a total purchase price of approximately $167.6 million. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Partnership's incentive distribution rights were cancelled.
- Following the Effective Time, Höegh LNG owns 100% of the common units in the Partnership, and the common units have been delisted from the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). The Partnership's Series A cumulative redeemable preferred units ("Series A preferred units") remain outstanding.
- On November 15, 2022, paid a cash distribution of $0.546875 per 8.75% Series A preferred unit, for the period commencing on August 16, 2022 to November 14, 2022.

Financial Results Overview
The Partnership has mitigated the risk of an outbreak of COVID‑19 on board its vessels by extending time between crew rotations on the vessels and developing mitigating actions for crew rotations. The Partnership has fulfilled its obligations under its time charter contracts, and except for 22 days of off-hire incurred for the planned maintenance and class renewal for the Neptune , did not experience any off-hire for its FSRUs for the three months ended September 30, 2022.
Total time charter revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2022 were $36.9 million (Q3 2021: $35.6 million). The increase in total time charter revenues is mainly due to increased time charter revenue for the Höegh Gallant commencing new charter under the contract with subsidiaries of New Fortress Energy Inc ("NFE") in late 2021 partially offset by a decrease in time charter revenues for the PGN FSRU Lampung and the Höegh Grace .
Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 were $21.2 million (Q3 2021: $14.5 million). The increase is principally due to higher vessel operating expenses and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared with the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in vessel operating expenses is mainly related to higher operating costs for the Höegh Gallant incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in administrative expenses is mainly related to external financial advisory fees, insurance premiums and legal fees incurred in relation to the Merger Agreement with Höegh LNG and legal fees incurred in relation to the dispute with the charterer of the PGN FSRU Lampung.
Equity in earnings of joint ventures for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $2.5 million (Q3 2021: $6.1 million). The joint ventures own the Neptune and the Cape Ann . Unrealized gains on derivative instruments in the Partnership's joint ventures impacted the equity in earnings of joint ventures for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The joint ventures have previously not applied hedge accounting for interest rate swaps, and all changes in fair value have been included in equity in earnings (losses) of joint ventures. After the refinancing of the Neptune debt facility on November 30, 2021, hedge accounting is applied for the Neptune . After the refinancing of the Cape Ann debt facility on June 1, 2022, hedge accounting is also applied for the Cape Ann .
Excluding the unrealized gains on derivative instruments for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the equity in earnings of joint ventures for the three months ended September 30, 2022 would have been $2.5 million (Q3 2021: $3.8 million). Excluding the unrealized gains on derivative instruments for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the decrease was mainly due to certain non-reimbursable operating expenses incurred in connection with the planned maintenance and class renewal of the Neptune for the three months ended September 30, 2022, and reduced time charter revenues due to 22 days of off-hire incurred for the planned maintenance and class renewal for the Neptune. The decrease was partly offset by lower financial expenses during 2022 due to refinancing of the two joint ventures' debt facilities in the fourth quarter of 2021 and second quarter of 2022.
The Partnership's share of its joint ventures' operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $4.2 million (Q3 2021: $6.4 million).
Segment EBITDA 1 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $27.5 million (Q3 2021: $35.1 million).
Operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $18.2 million (Q3 2021: $27.1 million).
Excluding the impact of the unrealized gains on derivatives impacting the equity in earnings of joint ventures, operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 would have been $18.2 million (Q3 2021: $24.9 million). The decrease is primarily due to higher operating expenses, administrative expenses and lower equity in earnings of joint ventures mainly due to the planned maintenance and class renewal for the Neptune partially offset by higher time charter revenues.
Total financial expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $5.8 million, (Q3 2021: $7.0 million).
Interest expense consists of the interest incurred, amortization and gain (loss) on cash flow hedges, commitment fees and amortization of debt issuance costs for the period. The decrease of $0.6 million in interest expense in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021 was principally due to incurred commitment fees and higher bank fees in the third quarter of 2021 related to refinancing activities on the PGN FSRU Lampung debt facility (the "Lampung facility").
The Partnership reported net income is $16.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 (Q3 2021: $17.4 million).
Net income was impacted by unrealized gains on derivative instruments for the third quarter of 2021, mainly included in the Partnership's share of equity in earnings of joint ventures.
Excluding all of the unrealized gains on derivative instruments, net income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 would have been $16.7 million (Q3 2021: $15.1 million). Excluding the impact of the unrealized gains on derivatives, the increase is primarily due to a decrease in uncertain tax liabilities and refund of additional taxes paid and expensed in 2021 in connection with a tax audit for the PGN FSRU Lampung for the tax year 2019. The Partnership has disputed the result of the tax audit, and during the third quarter of 2022, the Central Jakarta regional tax office changed its position, resulting in a refund of some of the additional taxes paid for 2019, and a reassessment by the Partnership of the uncertain tax liability.
Preferred unitholders' interest in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $3.9 million. Limited partners' interest in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $12.7 million (Q3 2021: $13.4 million).
Excluding all of the unrealized gains on derivative instruments, limited partners' interest in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 would have been $12.9 million (Q3 2021: $11.1 million).

Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used by investors to measure financial and operating performance. Please see Appendix A for a reconciliation of Segment EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Segment Information
The Partnership has two operating segments. The segment profit measure is Segment EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairment, and other financial items (gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other items, net). The two segments are "Majority held FSRUs" and "Joint venture FSRUs." In addition, unallocated corporate costs, interest income from advances to joint ventures, and interest expense related to the outstanding balances on the $85 million revolving credit facility and the $385 million facility are included in "Other". For additional information on the segments, including a reconciliation of Segment EBITDA to operating income and net income for each segment, refer to the description and the tables included in "Unaudited Segment Information for the Quarters Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021" below.
Segment EBITDA for Majority held FSRUs for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $26.9 million (Q3 2021: $28.3 million). The decrease is mainly due to increased vessel operating expenses and administrative expenses partly offset by increased revenue from time charters.
Segment EBITDA for the Joint venture FSRUs for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $6.6 million (Q3 2021: $8.9 million). The decrease is mainly due to increased vessel operating expenses and reduced time charter revenues due to 22 days of off-hire due to the class renewal on the Neptune that was completed during the third quarter of 2022.
Other, Segment EBITDA consists of administrative expenses. Administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 were $6.0 million (Q3 2021: $2.1 million).
Financing and Liquidity
As of September 30, 2022, the Partnership had cash and cash equivalents of $45.3 million. Current restricted cash for operating obligations of the PGN FSRU Lampung was $9.3 million, and long-term restricted cash required under the long-term debt facility for the Lampung facility was $11.0 million as of September 30, 2022. As of November 17, 2022, the Partnership has fully drawn on the $63 million revolving credit tranche of the $385 million facility and has an undrawn balance of $60.5 million on the $85 million revolving credit facility from Höegh LNG. As of September 30, 2022, the outstanding balance of $24.5 million on the $85 million revolving credit facility from Höegh LNG is classified as a current liability. Further drawdowns on the $85 million revolving credit facility may be subject to Höegh LNG's consent because of the notice of arbitration received from the charterer of the PGN FSRU Lampung , as described below.
As of September 30, 2022, the Partnership has no material commitments for capital expenditures.
During the third quarter of 2022, the Partnership made quarterly repayments of $5.4 million on the Lampung facility and $6.4 million on the $385 million facility. The repayment $5.4 million on the Lampung facility includes ordinary installments of $4.5 million and additional installments of $0.9 million due to the cash sweep mechanism in the Lampung facility. Until the pending arbitration with the charterer of PGN FSRU Lampung has been terminated, cancelled or favorably resolved, no shareholder loans may be serviced and no dividends may be paid to the Partnership by the subsidiary borrowing under the Lampung facility, PT Hoegh LNG Lampung ("PT HLNG"). Furthermore, each quarter, 50% of the PGN FSRU Lampung's generated cash flow after debt service must be applied to pre-pay outstanding loan amounts under the Lampung facility, applied pro rata across the commercial and export credit tranches. The remaining 50% will be retained by PT HLNG and pledged in favour of the lenders until the pending arbitration with the charterer of the PGN FSRU Lampung has been terminated, cancelled or favorably resolved. As a consequence, no cash flow from the PGN FSRU Lampung will be available for the Partnership until the pending arbitration has been terminated, cancelled or favorably resolved. This limitation does not prohibit the Partnership from paying distributions to preferred and common unitholders.
The Partnership's book value and outstanding principal of total long-term debt were $349.6 million and $353.9 million respectively, as of September 30, 2022, including the Lampung facility, the $385 million facility and the $85 million revolving credit facility.
As of September 30, 2022, the Partnership's total current liabilities exceeded total current assets by $11.0 million. This is partly a result of the current portion of long-term debt of $43.7 million being classified as current while restricted cash of $11.0 million associated with the Lampung facility is classified as long-term. The current portion of long-term debt reflects principal payments for the next twelve months. Additionally, because the $85 million revolving credit facility from Höegh LNG matures on January 1, 2023, the outstanding balance thereunder of $24.5 million is classified as a current liability.
The current liabilities are expected to be funded, for the most part, by future cash flows from operations. The Partnership does not intend to maintain a cash balance to fund the next twelve months' net liabilities. The Partnership believes its cash flows from operations, including distributions to it from Höegh LNG Cyprus Limited, and Höegh LNG FSRU IV Ltd as payment of intercompany interest and/or intercompany debt or dividends and payments under the Suspension and Make-Whole Agreements (as defined below), will be sufficient to meet its debt amortization and working capital needs and maintain cash reserves against fluctuations in operating cash flows and pay distributions to its unitholders at its current level of distributions, for the next twelve months assuming continuing compliance with covenants under its credit facilities and assuming that the Partnership's vessels remain fully operational and that revenues are generated as per existing contractual terms.
As of September 30, 2022, the Partnership had outstanding interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of $247.5 million to hedge against the floating interest rate risks of its long-term debt under the Lampung facility and the $385 million facility. The Partnership applies hedge accounting for derivative instruments related to these facilities. The Partnership receives interest based on three-month US dollar LIBOR and pays a fixed rate of 2.8% for the Lampung facility. The Partnership receives interest based on the three-month US dollar LIBOR and pays a fixed rate ranging from 2.650% to 2.941% for the $385 million facility.
The Partnership's share of the joint ventures is accounted for using the equity method. As a result, the Partnership's share of the joint ventures' cash, restricted cash, outstanding debt, interest rate swaps and other balance sheet items are reflected net on the lines "accumulated earnings in joint ventures" and "accumulated losses in joint ventures" on the consolidated balance sheet and are not included in the balance sheet figures disclosed below.
In August 2022, the Partnership paid a cash distribution of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per common unit, with respect to the second quarter of 2022.
In August 2022, the Partnership paid a cash distribution of $3.9 million, or $0.546875 per Series A preferred unit, for the period commencing on May 16, 2022 to August 14, 2022.
On November 15, 2022, the Partnership paid a cash distribution of $3.9 million, or $0.546875 per Series A preferred unit, for the period commencing on August 15, 2022 to November 14, 2022.
Outlook
The Partnership believes its primary risk and exposure related to uncertainty of cash flows from its long-term time charter contracts is due to the credit risk and counterparty risk associated with the individual charterers. Payments are due under time charter contracts regardless of the demand for the charterer's gas output or the utilization of the FSRU. It is therefore possible that charterers may not make payments for time charter services in times of reduced demand. While there is a pending arbitration as further discussed below, as of November 17, 2022, the Partnership has not experienced any reduced or non-payments for obligations under the Partnership's time charter contracts. In addition, the Partnership has not provided concessions or made changes to the terms of payment for its customers.
Höegh LNG has entered into the Suspension and Make-Whole Agreements and provided the Partnership the $85 million revolving credit facility. However, in July 2021, the Partnership received notice from Höegh LNG that the revolving credit line of $85 million will not be extended when it matures on January 1, 2023, and that Höegh LNG will have very limited capacity to extend any additional advances to the Partnership beyond what is currently drawn under such facility. Also, further drawdowns on the $85 million revolving credit facility may be subject to Höegh LNG's consent because of the NOA (as defined below) received from the charterer of PGN FSRU Lampung . With these changes, the Partnership's liquidity and financial flexibility has been reduced. If Höegh LNG is unable to meet its obligations to us under the Suspension and Make-Whole Agreements or meet funding requests or indemnification obligations, our financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders could be materially adversely affected.
Höegh LNG's ability to make payments to the Partnership under the Suspension and Make-Whole Agreements and any funding requests under the $85 million revolving credit facility and any claims for indemnification may be affected by events beyond the control of Höegh LNG or the Partnership, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, Höegh LNG's ability to meet its obligations to the Partnership may be impaired.
If financial institutions providing the Partnership's interest rate swaps are unable to meet their obligations, the Partnership could experience a higher interest expense or be unable to obtain funding. Furthermore, if the Partnership's charterers or lenders are unable to meet their obligations under their respective contracts or if the Partnership is unable to fulfill its obligations under time charters, its financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders could be materially adversely affected.
As previously reported, by letter dated July 13, 2021, the charterer under the lease and maintenance agreement for the PGN FSRU Lampung ("LOM") raised certain issues with PT Hoegh LNG Lampung in relation to the operations of the PGN FSRU Lampung and the LOM and by further letter dated July 27, 2021, stated that it would commence arbitration against PT Hoegh LNG Lampung. On August 2, 2021, the charterer served a notice of arbitration ("NOA") to declare the LOM null and void, and/or to terminate the LOM, and/or seek damages. On June 13, 2022, the charterer filed a statement of claim with a request for a primary relief and three alternative reliefs. The charterer's claim of restitution if the LOM is declared null and void is $416 million, increasing to $472 million by June 2023 plus interest and costs. In September 2022, PT Hoegh LNG Lampung filed its Statement of Defense.
PT Hoegh LNG Lampung has previously served a reply refuting the claims as baseless and without legal merit and has also served a counterclaim against the charterer for multiple breaches of the LOM and a claim against the parent company of the charterer for the fulfilment of the charterer's obligations under the LOM as stated in a guarantee provided by the parent company, with a claim for damages. On June 13, 2022, PT Hoegh LNG Lampung filed its statement of claim.
PT Hoegh LNG Lampung will take all necessary steps and will vigorously contest the charterer's claims in the legal process.
No assurance can be given at this time as to the outcome of the dispute with the charterer of the PGN FSRU Lampung . Notwithstanding the NOA, both parties have continued to perform their respective obligations under the LOM. In the event that the outcome of such dispute is unfavorable to the Partnership, it could have a material adverse impact on its business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions to unitholders.
On March 20, 2022, the Partnership commenced FSRU operations under agreements with subsidiaries of New Fortress Energy Inc. ("New Fortress") to charter the Höegh Gallant for a period of ten years (the "NFE Charter"). The charter rate under the NFE Charter is lower than under the prior charter for the Höegh Gallant (the "Suspended Gallant Charter"). The Partnership has entered into an agreement to suspend the Suspended Gallant Charter, with effect from the commencement of the NFE Charter, and a make-whole agreement (together, the "Suspension and Make-Whole Agreements"), pursuant to which Höegh LNG's subsidiary will compensate the Partnership monthly for the difference between the charter rate earned under the NFE Charter and the charter rate earned under the Suspended Gallant Charter with the addition of a modest increase until July 31, 2025, the original expiration date of the Suspended Gallant Charter. Afterwards, the Partnership will continue to receive the charter rate agreed with New Fortress for the remaining term of the NFE Charter. In addition, pursuant to the Suspension and Make-Whole Agreements, certain capital expenditures incurred to ready and relocate the Höegh Gallant for performance under the NFE Charter will be shared 50/50 between Höegh LNG and the Partnership, subject to a maximum obligation of the Partnership. As of November 17, 2022, Höegh LNG has paid an aggregate of $2.6 million to the Partnership pursuant to the Suspension and Make-Whole Agreements related to such capital expenditures.
The outbreak of COVID‑19 has negatively affected economic conditions in many parts of the world which may impact the Partnership's operations and the operations of its customers and suppliers. Although the Partnership's operations have not been materially affected by the COVID-19 outbreak to date, the ultimate length and severity of the COVID‑19 outbreak and its potential impact on the Partnership's operations and financial condition is uncertain at this time. Furthermore, should there be an outbreak of COVID‑19 on board one of the Partnership's FSRUs or an inability to replace critical supplies or replacement parts due to disruptions to third-party suppliers, adequate crewing or supplies may not be available to fulfill the Partnership's obligations under its time charter contracts. This could result in off-hire or warranty payments under performance guarantees which would reduce revenues for the impacted period. To date, the Partnership has extended the time between crew rotations on the vessels and developed other mitigating actions to reduce the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak. As a result, the Partnership expects that it will incur somewhat higher crewing expenses. To date, the Partnership has not had material service interruptions on the Partnership's vessels. Management and administrative staffs have largely transitioned to working remotely from home to address the specific COVID‑19 situation in the applicable geographic location. The Partnership has supported staffs by supplying needed internet boosters and office equipment to facilitate an effective work environment.
In February 2022, the Russian attack on Ukraine started. It may lead to further regional and international conflicts or armed action. It is possible that such conflict could disrupt supply chains and cause instability in the global economy. Additionally, the ongoing conflict could result in the imposition of further economic sanctions by the United States and the European Union against Russia. While much uncertainty remains regarding the global impact of the invasion, it is possible that such tensions could adversely affect the Partnership's business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. Furthermore, it is possible that third parties with whom the Partnership has charter contracts may be impacted by events in Russia and Ukraine, which could adversely affect its operations. The invasion has among other things, led to a significantly increased attention to security of energy supply in Europe. Several European countries are looking to reduce their reliance on pipeline gas from Russia, and are planning to increase the import capacity for LNG through the application of FSRUs and/or landbased import facilities in combination with increased use of renewable energy sources in the energy mix. Over time, this could accelerate the energy transition to renewable energy.
On April 1, 2022, the Partnership's Colombian subsidiary received a notification from the Tax Administration of Cartagena assessing a penalty of approximately $1.8 million for failure to file the 2016 to 2018 Municipal Industry and Commerce Tax ("ICT") returns. ICT is imposed on gross receipts on customer invoices and is similar to a sales tax. The municipal tax authorities have alleged that the customer invoices are for industrial activities performed within the municipal jurisdiction. However, all of the Colombian subsidiary's activities take place offshore which is outside of the Municipality's borders. According to Colombian law, municipalities do not have jurisdiction over maritime waters or low-tide areas. Management intends to deny the allegations and file an appeal to vigorously defend the Colombian subsidiary's position. Accruals for loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management, with advice of its outside legal advisors, has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that an adverse judgment after concluding an appeals process is not probable. As a result, no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements. Management estimates the range of possible loss for 2016-2021, including accrued interest, to be approximately $1.3 million to $2.9 million as of September 30, 2022, plus additional accrued interest thereon until final disposition of the ICT allegation. In May 2022, the Partnership and its Colombian subsidiary filed a response to the Tax Administration of Cartagena disputing the claim. This was confirmed registered on May 27, 2022, by the Tax Administration of Cartagena.

HÖEGH LNG PARTNERS LP
UNAUDITED SEGMENT INFORMATION FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 and 2021
(in thousands of U.S. dollars)
Segment information
There are two operating segments. The segment profit measure is Segment EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairment and other financial items (gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other items, net). Segment EBITDA is reconciled to operating income and net income in the segment presentation below. The two segments are "Majority held FSRUs" and "Joint venture FSRUs." In addition, unallocated corporate costs, interest income from advances to joint ventures and interest expense related to the outstanding balances on the $85 million revolving credit facility and the $385 million facility are included in "Other."
For the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, Majority held FSRUs includes the financing lease related to the PGN FSRU Lampung and the operating leases related to the Höegh Gallant and the Höegh Grace.
For the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, Joint Venture FSRUs include two 50% owned FSRUs, the Neptune and the Cape Ann , that operate under long-term time charters with one charterer.
The accounting policies applied to the segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements, except that i) Joint venture FSRUs is presented under the proportional consolidation method for the segment note to the Partnership's financial statements and in the tables below, and under equity accounting for the consolidated financial statements and ii) internal interest income and interest expense between the Partnership's subsidiaries that eliminate in consolidation are not included in the segment columns for the other financial income (expense), net line. Under the proportional consolidation method, 50% of the Joint venture FSRUs' revenues, expenses and assets are reflected in the segment note. Management monitors the results of operations of joint ventures under the proportional consolidation method and not the equity method of accounting.

Appendix A: Segment EBITDA
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Segment EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Segment EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes depreciation, amortization, impairment and other financial items. Other financial items consist of gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other items, net (including foreign exchange gains and losses and withholding tax on interest expenses). Segment EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and external users of financial statements, such as the Partnership's lenders, to assess its financial and operating performance. The Partnership believes that Segment EBITDA assists its management and investors by increasing the comparability of its performance from period to period and against the performance of other companies in the industry that provide Segment EBITDA information. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods or companies of interest, depreciation, amortization, impairment, taxes, and other financial items, which items are affected by various and possibly changing financing methods, capital structure and historical cost basis and which items may significantly affect net income between periods. The Partnership believes that including Segment EBITDA as a financial and operating measure benefits investors in (a) selecting between investing in it and other investment alternatives and (b) monitoring its ongoing financial and operational strength in assessing whether to continue to hold common units or preferred units. Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Segment EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income, and these measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, Segment EBITDA as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The following tables reconcile Segment EBITDA for each of the segments and the Partnership as a whole to net income (loss), the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, for the periods presented:

Full text: After Thanksgiving, shoppers scour malls and the Internet to find the best deals on holiday items on Black Friday and Small Business Saturday. That weekend also encourages people to visit museums and support these institutions by perusing the aisle at their gift shops on Nov. 27, known as Museum Store Sunday.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- After Thanksgiving, shoppers scour malls and the Internet to find the best deals on holiday items on Black Friday and Small Business Saturday. That weekend also encourages people to visit museums and support these institutions by perusing the aisle at their gift shops on Nov. 27, known as Museum Store Sunday.
Honoring museums and what they do in presenting history to visitors, The Los Angeles-based The TeaBook is partnering with the Museum of Latin American Art (MOLAA) to present a special tea party with arts and crafts activities to celebrate Hispanic culture. Also, appearing on that day will be Los Angeles-based Mexican illustrator and writer Mirelle Ortega who will give a presentation about her drawing methods. She has created covers for award-winning middle-grade book series such as "From The Desk of Zoe Washington," "Cece Rios," and "Love Sugar Magic" and artwork for acclaimed chapter book series such as "The Mythics," "Vote For Effie," and "Mermaids Rock." Ortega's debut picture book as an author "Magic: Once Upon a Faraway Land" was jury selected by the Society of Illustrators' (SOI) Original Art Show, an annual exhibit created to showcase illustrations from the year's best children's books published in the U.S.
The TeaBook's owner Noah Bleich chose to sell his organic, kosher, Non-GMO and wheat-free teas as unique gift items in museums like the Seattle Art Museum, San Diego Museum of Art, and ScienceWorks Hands-On Museum in Ashland, Oregon because of what they do for people.
"There's a correlation between what we make which are teas and what museums do, and that is to educate people," Bleich said. "The characters that appear on our artistically drawn and designed tea wrappers are historical. Most museums have some form of a historical component. These museums are presenting things that have been discovered in the past."
He explained that museums and his teas provide an interactive element. Bleich's artists draw hidden items found on the tea wrappers that are part of the company's creative intellectual property. For example, looking at ShakeSpearmint tea which pays homage to William Shakespeare, the wrapper contains an embracing couple which is a nod to "Romeo and Juliet," and the calendar date of March 15 known as the Ides of March from "Julius Caesar." Some people, Bleich said, are so taken with the teas that they save them as collector's items.
"Learning about these historical figures and artists and finding these hidden items on the wrappers brings up a conversation, whether it's positive or negative," he said. "Museums also invoke conversations about the people, places, and things presented in their spaces. We are aligned in that way."
Bleich credits his passion for art and history stems from his Jewish roots and from his late mother Linda D. Bleich, who was a special education teacher.
"She always believed that education was crucial," he said. "If you don't know about something, you could be easily misled because you have no other reference," he said.
About The TeaBook
The TeaBook is a patented tea organizer designed to help people store, share, and serve their tea. The TeaBook is a specially designed book that stores up to 144 teas, offering a lightweight design that's been created without animal products or BPA.

Full text: CINCINNATI, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Mark Hauser and Hauser Private Equity are pleased to announce that ten of its fund managers have been named to Inc. Magazine's "2022 List of Founder-Friendly Investors," which honors private equity firms with best-in-class records for successfully partnering with entrepreneurs, founders, and family-led businesses.
"Founder-led businesses are at the core of our investment thesis," said Mark Hauser, Founder and Co-Managing Partner of Hauser Private Equity . "We look to invest with managers who are experts in their field at identifying proprietary assets and partnering with those operators and sellers to drive maximum growth."
Hauser Private Equity manages five private equity funds for HNW and UHNW investors. Nine of its managers were named to the Inc. list for 2021. "Fully investing in an entrepreneur, and their innovative vision involves far more than the financial investment. By developing relationships with and supporting entrepreneurs for the long-term, these private equity firms are more than investors, they're partners," says Scott Omelianuk, editor-in-chief of Inc. media.
Managers like North Castle Partners have been long-standing top performers for Hauser Private Equity. For more than two decades, most of North Castle's portfolio companies have been led by founders. Currently, 65% of their partner companies have founders serving as CEO or in other leadership roles. A perfect example of this success is the recent investment in CR Fitness, a significant co-investment for Hauser Private Equity, and a continuation of the prior investment through the fund.
CR Fitness has rapidly expanded its Crunch gym footprint across the U.S., with 45 locations across Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Texas. CR Fitness has more than doubled its footprint and tripled its revenue since North Castle invested in 2019. "We chose North Castle as our partner based on the belief that they had the knowledge and expertise to deliver real value to our business – and they have exceeded our teams' expectations. We are ecstatic to continue on with them as our partners and are confident that we can achieve our goal of doubling our club count over the next few years," commented Vince Julien, Founder, and Chairman of CR Fitness.
Operational excellence is key to success and a major factor in Hauser Private Equity's diligence process. "The Inc. list is a great representation of funds, like Clearlake and Shore, who successfully drive value with deep industry knowledge," said Mark Hauser, "and work their operational improvements into their partnership with management."
About Hauser Private Equity Hauser Private Equity , a Cincinnati-based private equity firm with offices in Los Angeles and Chicago, is focused on fund investments and co-investments within the middle market inclusive of Healthcare, Business Services, Tech-enabled Services, Industrials, and Consumer Goods. HPE targets funds between $250M and $2B in size with managers showing successful track records in their dedicated areas of expertise. The HPE funds are committed to over 45 private equity fund managers across the country and co-invest exclusively in control buyout deals led by existing GPs. The firm was founded in 2008 by Mark Hauser , following the success of multiple private investment partnerships and merchant banking transactions.

About Inc. To compile the list, Inc. went straight to the source: entrepreneurs who have sold to private equity and venture capital firms. Founders filled out a questionnaire about their experiences partnering with private equity and venture capital firms and shared data on how their portfolio companies have grown during these partnerships.
To see the complete list, go to: https://www.inc.com/founder-friendly-investors/2022. The October 2022 issue of Inc. magazine is available online at https://www.inc.com/magazine and on newsstands now.
The "Founder-Friendly Investors" award is a program designed by Inc. Magazine to help founder-led companies accelerate growth and create revenue.  Private equity and venture capital firms that have exited U.S.-based, founder-led portfolio companies are eligible to apply.  For investments to qualify, portfolio company founders must have remained actively involved in their business for at least one-year post-investment.  Winning firms are selected based on their investments and founder references.  Hauser is not aware of the number of advisers also surveyed for the award.  This award is not to be construed as indicative of Hauser's future performance. Reference to an award is only one piece of information relevant to an evaluation of an investment adviser such as Hauser.  Finally, this award represents information as of a specific date and time and may not reflect important information related to an evaluation of the investment adviser which has occurred prior to, or subsequent to, the award.

Full text: - Gary Bedard appointed as President of the Residential segment; Doug Young, current President, retiring after a distinguished 24-year career
- Company exploring strategic alternatives for the Refrigeration segment's European operations
- Refrigeration to be consolidated with the Commercial segment to accelerate productivity and growth

DALLAS, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Lennox International Inc. (NYSE: LII), a leader in energy-efficient climate control solutions, today announced the appointment of Gary Bedard as President of the Residential business segment, effective January 1, 2023. Bedard succeeds Doug Young, who is retiring following a distinguished 24-year career at the company. Young's retirement is effective June 30, 2023, to ensure a seamless transition and maintain momentum on critical business initiatives, including share gain opportunities.
For the last five years, Bedard led the Refrigeration segment and previously spent 19 years in the Residential business in general management, sales, product, and marketing leadership roles.  From 2007 to 2017, he led the Lennox Residential business, during which time the business experienced consistent market share gains. "Gary is a seasoned leader with a long track record of success over his 24 years at Lennox," said CEO Alok Maskara. "Our Residential business is well-positioned for long-term share growth and margin expansion under Gary's leadership."
"I'd like to thank Doug for his significant and far-reaching contributions to Lennox," said Maskara. "To drive growth and profitability, Doug and the Residential team expanded the Lennox distribution network and built three manufacturing facilities in Mexico. The team also introduced the most energy-efficient heating and cooling solutions in the industry and a controls platform with industry-leading prognostic and diagnostic capabilities." Under Doug's leadership of the Residential segment, revenue doubled to more than $3 billion, profit tripled to more than $600 million, and profit margin expanded more than 600 basis points to over 18%.
The company also announced the decision to explore strategic alternatives for its European commercial HVAC and refrigeration businesses, which represent approximately 5% of the company's revenue. "This decision is consistent with our focus on North America, where we are best positioned to achieve our revenue growth and profit margin targets," said Maskara.
The company will continue to invest in its high-performing North American Heatcraft Refrigeration Products (HRP) business, which will become part of the Commercial segment under the leadership of Joe Nassab. The company will start reporting its financial results in two segments, Residential and Commercial, effective January 1, 2023. "We are excited to have Joe lead the newly combined Commercial segment to accelerate growth and deliver the full profit potential," Maskara said. "Joe is a 12-year veteran of the company, with a record of strong growth and margin expansion leading our Allied Air business before taking over as President of the Commercial business segment earlier this year." Maskara added, "With an even sharper focus on North America, Lennox has significant opportunities ahead to accelerate profitable growth over the coming years under the leadership of Gary and Joe in our Residential and Commercial businesses respectively."
Lennox International Investor Day
Lennox International will be hosting its 2022 Investor Day in New York City on Wednesday, December 14, beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.

MIAMI, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The rise of remote work is levelling the playing field when it comes to accessing talent, but for many organizations international hiring is overwhelming and they don't know where to start.
GoGlobal, an Employer of Record (EOR), is launching a new solution called Recruit & Hire that will help companies look beyond their borders to find the right person for the right role at the right price.
Nick Broughton, GoGlobal Partner, says, "Remote work is the great equalizer when it comes to talent. It has not only transformed the way we think work can be done — shattering the idea that people must be in the office to be productive and contributing— but has also opened up a global talent pool of millions of people that have previously been underappreciate, ignored or inaccessible."
One of the most important considerations in hiring internationally is to partner with an EOR that can also serve remote global hiring needs. GoGlobal's Recruit & Hire offers clients the end-to-end solution, right from sourcing through all the stages to an eventual off-boarding
"With our in-house regional talent acquisition teams and global network of vetted recruitment partners, GoGlobal can source and engage remote talent in days and offer expertise in local salary benchmarking, talent pool sourcing and in-country HR regulations and best practices," says Harry Dhillon, GoGlobal's Director of Recruitment.
There are many benefits to working with an EOR and recruitment partner on a global recruitment strategy. It's a quick way to gain access to new markets and find talent for hard-to-fill roles, like technology, sales and clients services. It also enables company to avoid entity set-up costs, fines and penalties. In addition to saving time and money, global remote recruitment supports corporate Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) strategies, which are becoming increasingly important for talent development and overall business success.
"Remote hiring allows companies to build naturally diverse teams," explains Broughton. "Looking beyond traditional borders for talent creates teams that blend a range of cultures, ideas and perspectives. It also provides opportunities to highly-skilled candidates who may not be able to access traditional '9 to 5' jobs that require an in-office presence, such as women with young children at home, people with disabilities or individuals who are also at-home caregivers."
Learn more about GoGlobal's Recruit & Hire solution.
About GoGlobal GoGlobal is a people-first international HR and Employer of Record (EOR) service provider, with a globally distributed, naturally diverse remote workforce. GoGlobal's technology enabled EOR solution allows companies of all sizes to hire people anywhere in the world without the need to set up a local entity, opening new doors to rapid expansion and growth. With a presence in over 100 countries on six continents and growing, GoGlobal helps clients recruit, hire, manage and pay exceptional talent – quickly, cost effectively and compliantly.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- As customers flock to Meijer to stock up on ingredients for Thanksgiving entertaining, the Midwest retailer will turn their purchases of Meijer brand products into meals for those in need through its hallmark Simply Give hunger relief program. From Nov. 20-26, Meijer will donate one meal to Simply Give food pantries for every purchase including a food item from select Meijer brands.
"We've been a part of our customers' Thanksgiving meal traditions since we first opened our doors in 1934, which is very meaningful to us," Meijer President & CEO Rick Keyes said. "Our customers have proven to be so generous and supportive of Simply Give over the years so we're glad to give them one more way to support families in their communities this holiday."
The Simply Give program stocks the shelves of more than 400 food pantries in the communities Meijer serves each year and has generated more than $75 million since its 2008 inception.  
Qualifying products include any Meijer brand, Frederik's by Meijer, True Goodness by Meijer or Purple Cow food item.
"Thanksgiving is the perfect time to celebrate our Meijer brands because they are such a staple in our customers' holiday entertaining plans – from the Meijer brand baking ingredients they count on to perfect their favorite family recipe to the unique Frederik's by Meijer items they pick up to add a special flair to their meal," said Ben Hamlin, Director of Own Brand Foods at Meijer. "We're excited to deepen that tie to the spirit of the season by giving our customers one more reason to feel good about buying our products."
Customers interested in doing even more to support food insecurity in their communities can purchase a $10 Simply Give donation card in-store or as an add-on to their online Meijer pickup and home delivery orders all year long. The donation cards are then converted into Meijer food-only gift cards and given to a local food pantry partner in the store's community. Additionally, Meijer will double match any Simply Give cards purchased on Saturday, Dec. 17, turning every $10 contribution into $30 for a local food pantry.

New Features – Including Earned Wage Access 1  – Help Workers Better Manage Their Financial Lives and Give Employers a Hiring and Retention Advantage
ROSELAND, N.J., Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- ADP, a leading global technology company providing human capital management (HCM) solutions, today announced enhancements to its award-winning Wisely® by ADP payment platform with advanced capabilities and innovative features like Earned Wage Access (EWA), designed to give employees more control of their finances, and help employers better attract and retain talent.
The data-driven design of the Wisely platform provides an all-in-one solution for financial wellness Many workers today do not have a relationship with a bank or prefer not to rely on traditional banks. As the next generation of employees enters the workforce, they bring with them digital-driven preferences – including increasing dependence on mobile money management tools. Wisely by ADP provides workers with a secure, digital account 2 that helps them access their money, spend, plan and save with fewer fees and headaches. Their Wisely digital account 2 allows them to put all their sources of income in one place –creating a frictionless user experience for employees even when they change jobs. Wisely by ADP is accessible to all workers, whether they are W-2 or 1099. It's a compliant, unified payments solution that enhances efficiency – saving employers time and money.
The addition of the EWA feature, offered in partnership with DailyPay, gives employees access to wages they've earned before payday at no cost 3 right from myWisely.com or the free myWisely® app 4 . Earned wage access is becoming a key benefit differentiator. According to ADP research 5 , 91% of millennial workers and 82% of Generation Z workers said it is important for their employer to offer earned wage access. Over half (57%) of Generation X and baby boomer workers said it is important to them as well. 
"The Wisely platform solves problems ADP understands better than anyone else," said Gautam Sukumar, SVP and general manager, Employee Financial Solutions at ADP. "The data-driven design of the Wisely platform provides an all-in-one solution and enhanced user experience that puts financial wellness, money management and spending flexibility into every employee's hands. It's the future of paying, earning, spending and saving." 
As employers and employees adapt to shifting economic and labor pressures, approximately 95 percent of employers say employee financial wellness impacts their productivity, and more than 90 percent say offering financial wellness tools helps attract and retain talent, according to ADP research 5 .
In addition to EWA, Wisely by ADP offers:
- Bill Pay 6 .  Right within the myWisely app, Wisely members can easily snap a photo of their bill, import an image of a paperless bill, or manually enter the billing information and have the payment deducted from their Wisely account.
- Savings Envelopes 7 .  Wisely helps members save with an auto-save feature and the ability to create savings envelopes right in the myWisely app. In fact, Wisely members have saved more than $1.3B in the past nineteen months.
- Rewards . With Cash Back Rewards 8 , members can earn cash back when they shop, travel or dine, with cash back going to the savings envelope in the myWisely app. Or members can get offers up to 10% cash back when purchasing eGift cards 8 in the myWisely app.
- Access to Mobile Wallets. Prior to getting a physical card, Wisely members can add their Wisely account to their favorite digital wallet to enable a seamless and touchless experience when using Wisely.  
- New Brand . In addition to the enhanced feature set, Wisely by ADP has also updated their brand strategy and visual identity to better connect with clients and members. The new, bold brand is reflective of Wisely's innovation and focus on offering employers flexibility for every payment scenario, while empowering employees with digital financial wellness tools. 

Wisely by ADP integrates seamlessly with enterprise resource planning (ERP) and payroll systems and uses industry-leading technology to streamline payments, pay statement processes and employee information management, making it easier and more cost effective to make off-cycle, and enable one-time and early payments.

Full text: MILWAUKEE, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Ademi LLP is investigating Elevate (NYSE: ELVT) for possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law in its transaction with Park Cities. 
Click here to learn how to join the action https://www.ademilaw.com/case/elevate-credit-inc or call Guri Ademi toll-free at 866-264-3995.  There is no cost or obligation to you.
Ademi LLP alleges Elevate's financial outlook and prospects are excellent and yet Elevate holders will receive only $1.87 per share in an all-cash transaction at an implied value of $67 million. The transaction agreement also allows 7% of shares and shares underlying equity awards held by certain members of Elevate management to rollover into equity affiliated with Park Cities. The transaction agreement unreasonably limits competing bids for Elevate by imposing a significant penalty if Elevate accepts a superior bid. Elevate insiders will receive substantial benefits as part of change of control arrangements.
We are investigating the conduct of Elevate's board of directors, and whether they are (i) fulfilling their fiduciary duties to all shareholders, and (ii) obtaining a fair and reasonable price for Elevate.
If you own Elevate common stock and wish to obtain additional information, please contact Guri Ademi either at gademi@ademilaw.com or toll-free: 866-264-3995, or https://www.ademilaw.com/case/elevate-credit-inc.

CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - Uranium Energy Corp (NYSE American: UEC) (the "Company" or "UEC") is pleased to announce that the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ("TCEQ") has approved the Company's submission for a renewed and expanded radioactive material license ("RML") for its Hobson Central Processing Plant.  
UEC's amended RML from the TCEQ increases the Hobson Processing Plant's licensed production capacity to 4 million pounds of U 3 O 8 annually.  This distinguishes the plant as having the largest licensed capacity in Texas and the second largest in the United States.  The Hobson Plant anchors UEC's hub-and-spoke in-situ recovery ("ISR") production platform in South Texas and will process uranium loaded resin recovered from multiple satellite projects including the Palangana and Burke Hollow ISR projects.
Amir Adnani, President and CEO stated: "We continue to execute on our strategy of growing UEC's leadership as a pure-play, un-hedged uranium supplier in politically stable jurisdictions. Today's achievement increases and advances our production capabilities in South Texas as we work towards the Company's return to production.  We are pleased with the TCEQ's approval of a renewed and expanded licensed capacity at our Hobson Central Processing Plant. Expanding the licensed production capability to four million pounds per year is an important step in providing the Company upward flexibility without permitting delays for our South Texas hub-and-spoke production platform."
UEC is also pleased to announce that baseline sampling at its Burke Hollow project's first production area is complete, and that the production area pump test has been conducted successfully.  Baseline sampling of all production area monitor wells and a production area pump test are important steps in finalizing the authorization for production within the already approved Mine Permit area.  Due to the success of these endeavors, UEC is now one step closer to initiating production at Burke Hollow and is also now preparing for the second production area delineation drilling. 
The Burke Hollow project is the newest and largest ISR wellfield being developed in the U.S. 
About Uranium Energy Corp Uranium Energy Corp is the fastest growing supplier of the fuel for green energy transition to a low carbon future.  UEC is the largest, diversified North American focused uranium company, advancing the next generation of low-cost, environmentally friendly In-Situ Recovery (ISR) mining uranium projects in the United States and a pipeline of high-grade conventional projects in Canada.  The Company has two production-ready ISR hub and spoke platforms in South Texas and Wyoming, anchored by fully licensed and operational central processing plants. UEC also has seven U.S. ISR uranium projects with all their major permits in place. Additionally, the Company has diversified uranium holdings including: (1) one of the largest physical uranium portfolios of U.S. warehoused U 3 O 8 ; (2) a major equity stake in Uranium Royalty Corp., the only royalty company in the sector; and (3) a pipeline of resource stage uranium projects. The Company's operations are managed by professionals with decades of hands-on experience in the key facets of uranium exploration, development, and mining.

Full text: - Less than 25% of F ortune 100 CEOs are diverse, yet 93% of US leaders consider DE&I to be more important now than ever before.  
- 12% of Fortune 100 CEOs are women, 14% are ethnically diverse—a 1% increase from 2021.
- As pandemic upheaval wanes, companies return to more expansive view of CEO succession; in the United States, 83% of all current sitting CEOs are first-time CEOs, up from 77% in 2021.
CHICAGO, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Despite an overwhelming percentage of executives who consider diversity to be more important to their organization than it was just three years ago, the number of both women and racially and ethnically diverse CEOs among the Fortune 100 remains low at roughly one in four, according to the Route to the Top 2022 report from Heidrick & Struggles (NASDAQ: HSII). The firm is a premier provider of global leadership advisory and on-demand talent solutions, serving the senior-level talent and consulting needs of the world's top organizations.
The annual report, now in its 6 th year, found slight growth in the gender, ethnic, and racial diversity of these CEOs, to 24% in 2022, up from 22% a year ago. This is especially ironic since, according to Heidrick & Struggles' September 2022 report, Employees at the Center: What It Takes to Lead on DE&I No w, 93% of executives surveyed viewed diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) as a business initiative that has increased in importance since 2020—shedding light on a significant disconnect. The same report stated that 58% of CEOs said their companies are engaged in DE&I practices considered "leading edge" three years earlier.
Route to the Top 2022  also revealed that, among Fortune 100 CEOs, the number of women who hold the top position in 2022—12%—remains unchanged from 2021 (10% of those women are white and 2% are Black), whereas 14% of CEOs are ethnically diverse, up slightly from a year earlier. Among them, 6% are Asian or Asian American, 3% are Black or African American, 4% are Hispanic or Latino, and 1% are Middle Eastern.
"Substantial progress is being made in corporate DE&I efforts, but the fact remains that diversity advances among Fortune 100 CEOs is relatively unchanged," said Lyndon Taylor, regional managing partner of Heidrick & Struggles' CEO & Board of Directors Practice for the Americas and an advisor on diversity, equity, and inclusion strategies, "and while the advancements women and other diverse executives have made toward the CEO role are gaining momentum, we still aren't seeing that momentum pivot to notable increases in CEO appointments for these underrepresented groups."
Interestingly, the stagnant level of diversity among Fortune 100 CEOs contrasts sharply with the rise of diverse board members in Fortune 500 companies: both CEOs and boards had a record share of first-time appointments, but while the CEO role stayed stagnant in terms of diversity, boards were able to capitalize and increase diversity. Heidrick & Struggles'  Board Monitor  US 2022  report found record levels of seats filled by first-time directors, 43%, and women appointees, 45%, on Fortune 500 boards in 2021, while 41% were racially or ethnically diverse, on par with 2020.
"It's clear there is much work to be done as boards outline their paths for CEO succession," said Bonnie Gwin, vice chairman and co-managing partner of Heidrick's global CEO & Board of Directors Practice. "Based on this data, boards would benefit by focusing on development efforts for women and diverse leaders to equip them to step into CEO roles."
In another significant development, Route to the Top 2022 highlights that directors of Canadian and US companies are returning to a more expansive view of the CEO role as upheavals from the COVID-19 pandemic diminish. Thirty percent of CEOs had no previous C-suite experience prior to stepping into the chief executive role, higher than the 26% for CEOs globally. Leadership growth within their existing organization has proven beneficial for CEO candidates, as more than three-quarters of new Canadian and US CEOs in the 2022 report were internal selections.
"As the pandemic wanes, boards and companies are looking beyond the traditional steppingstone roles of COO and CFO for their next leader," said Jeff Sanders, vice chairman and co-managing partner of the global CEO & Board of Directors Practice. "We are seeing a notable increase in CEOs with nontraditional backgrounds; in the United States, of CEOs 20% possess C-suite experiences beyond the big 3 roles—CEO, COO, and CFO—which contrasts with only 11% in 2020." 
As for overall changes in key global CEO demographics, little change was registered from 2021. The average CEO tenure was 6.8 years, up from 6.6 years the previous year. The average age at appointment remained 49.6, the percentage of CEOs appointed before age 45 remained at 25%, and the average age of sitting CEOs remained at 56.5.

Full text: ROP Check builds upon NeoLight's leading pediatric retina screening portfolio, adding digital management (schedule, document, bill, and transfer) for treating patients with retinopathy of prematurity.
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- One year after NeoLight's acquisition of Phoenix Technology Group, which brought newborn eye screening into the company's portfolio, NeoLight announced today that it is releasing ROP Check, the leading software in digital care coordination for pediatric retinal screening to detect and monitor progression of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), as part of their expanding product portfolio.
The addition of ROP Check to our product portfolio provides a significant opportunity to advance our digital strategy. "ROP Check has the unique ability to cross-functionally manage patients/parents, NICUs, NICU ROP Coordinators, in house or visiting ophthalmology specialists, billing specialists, discharge leaders and post discharge out-patient physicians seamlessly. It has been designed to be a very convenient patient care model for ROP" said Vivek Kopparthi, Co-founder & Executive Chairman, NeoLight.
"The addition of ROP Check to our product portfolio provides a significant opportunity to advance our digital strategy," said Arik Anderson, Chief Executive Officer, NeoLight. "We are providing solutions to real world problems clinicians face each day as part of newborn eye screening care."
The ROP Check SaaS centralized platform is uniquely positioned to address the unmet clinical need of missed babies for ROP screening by making it easier for the NICU, retina specialists and parents to share the same exams and schedule across both inpatient and outpatient practices. The ROP Check system is specifically designed to ensure all eligible babies in the NICU get eye exams at the right time and within established guidelines. The platform will ensure a smooth process for documenting, billing and transferring ROP patients.
"Adding ROP Check to our product portfolio will enable safer patient care and help our customers improve outcomes." Said MaryBeth Smith, NeoLight's Chief Commercial Officer.
ROP Check founders Dr. Jack Jacob and Dr. Bob Arnold said, "Adding ROP Check to NeoLight's product portfolio will provide us with the ability and resources to expand ROP Check's footprint to improve retinopathy of prematurity care for vulnerable babies."
NeoLight is creating a connected digital ecosystem centered around using technology to help eliminate ROP blindness worldwide. This ecosystem will enable clinicians to care for their patients in new and challenging circumstances and enable healthcare systems to deliver more consistent care while also managing costs.
"We have been using ROP check since 2013, and it has enabled us to have confidence that our patients are receiving continuity of care while hospitalized and following discharge, in the outpatient setting." Said Amy K. Hutchinson, MD, Professor of Ophthalmology, Emory University School of Medicine. "The application is convenient and allows for efficient documentation and review of exams. It allows us to manage ROP in multiple hospitals with a single platform that is easily accessible from any computer or mobile device."
NeoLight is a medical device company that develops empathy driven, best-in-class technologies for treating preventable conditions in the newborn care market. Empathy driven solutions are a framework that has the doctor-nurse-mother-infant ecosystem at the center. It fosters the emotional connection that happens, thereby providing not just treatment but also providing care. Driving neonatal care beyond the traditional hospital setting, NeoLight is also creating a robust home market to treat neonatal conditions in the home.

Full text: - For the 39 th year, PNC calculated the cost of Christmas
- The year-over-year increase in 2022 is the third highest on record
- Inflation for services far outstripped goods in this year's index

PITTSBURGH, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- True love costs a lot more this year, as record-high inflation drives PNC's 39 th annual Christmas Price Index® (PNC CPI) up 10.5%, the third highest year-over-year increase in the index's history. The PNC CPI, a light-hearted take on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Consumer Price Index, measures the average change in prices consumers should expect to pay for True Love's gifts, outlined in the classic holiday carol, "The Twelve Days of Christmas."
"True Loves will need to come up with a record $45,523.27 to buy those 12 perfect gifts this year," said Amanda Agati, chief investment officer for PNC Asset Management Group. "This is a disquieting development for many, as pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and elevated energy and commodity prices continue to impact the cost of goods and services. Despite True Loves' generous intentions, the gifts that make up the PNC CPI are not well-insulated from what is being experienced across the broader economy."
Driving much of the increase is the cost of some birds in the index. While the Partridge, Calling Birds and Swans saw no flight in price, the cost of others, including Turtle Doves, French Hens and Geese, flew up 20.1%. Services are also higher, contributing significantly to the overall increase.
The cost of all 12 gifts is reported on PNC's interactive website, which is meant to be as fun as it is educational. Highlights of the double-digit increase in the PNC CPI to $45,523.27 include:
- Far out fertilizer prices: A key driver of the spike in the pear tree is the cost of fertilizer, which saw growth of 28.4%.
- Soaring service costs : Services inflation, driven by increased wages and labor costs, is higher than goods inflation in the PNC CPI, much like the BLS CPI. This year, services in the PNC CPI, represented primarily by the performers, are up 14.5% while goods increased just 4.2%.
- Gold rings gaining: Given inflation concerns, some investors dashed for store-of-value assets like gold again this year. Gold ring prices are up a whopping 39% from 2021, reflecting the surge in the precious metal's price during the year.

"While the gifts in this specialty basket of goods and services are truly unique, investors and consumers alike might consider asking their True Love for a different kind of gift this year instead," Agati suggested.
The Federal Reserve has aggressively raised interest rates throughout the year to combat inflation against an already slowing economic growth backdrop and all indications are there is more to come.
"Markets continue to focus on two critical variables for the path forward: signs of inflation peaking and rolling over, and the Fed completing its tightening of financial conditions. In the absence of confirmation on both, we think the high volatility regime is going to continue to dominate and markets are likely to stay pretty choppy," she added.
Price Increases for Services Outstripped Goods in 2022
True Loves who want to delight can do so with performers, but at a price. The price of Nine Ladies Dancing climbed to new heights, as did the Ten Lords-a-Leaping, who jumped for joy as they returned to in-person performances. Eleven Pipers Piping rose to a new tune, and the 12 Drummers Drumming found a higher beat. In aggregate, prices for performers increased 14.6% this year.
Although many states and localities across the country have raised minimum wages recently, the federal minimum wage has not increased since July 2009; thus, the Eight Maids-a-Milking haven't seen a pay raise in more than a decade.
Unfortunately, tech-savvy True Loves will not save by going the e-commerce route. Buying all 12 gifts virtually is "just" 8.9% higher this year, still an eye-popping $49,663.73. Free shipping on livestock purchases is still not an option.
The annual PNC CPI tradition includes calculating the "True Cost of Christmas," which is the total cost of items bestowed by a True Love who repeats all the song's verses. Purchasing all 364 gifts will cost $197,071.09, which means that spreading cheer in 2022 costs 9.8% more than it did a year ago.
"Like the index, consumer behavior is the drumbeat for the U.S. economy," Agati said. "With 70% of U.S. GDP tied to consumption, consumer financial health is key to future market performance. We will be keeping an eye on guiding stars like retail sales, savings rates and consumer sentiment as indicators of the success of this holiday season."
Started in 1984 by a PNC predecessor bank in Philadelphia, the PNC CPI was initially developed to include in holiday messages to clients. Now, it is intended to educate consumers while spreading some holiday joy and highlighting market changes over time.

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Yatsen Holding Limited ("Yatsen" or the "Company") (NYSE: YSG) of a class action securities lawsuit.
CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Yatsen investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud. This lawsuit is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities who purchased Yatsen Holding Limited American Depository Shares ("ADS") between November 19, 2020 and March 10, 2022 or acquired Yatsen ADS pursuant or traceable to documents issued in connection with Yatsen's November 2020 initial public stock offering. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team:
https://www.zlk.com/pslra-1/yatsen-holding-loss-submission-form?prid=33765&wire=4
YSG  investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500.
CASE DETAILS: The filed complaint alleges that defendants made false statements and/or concealed that: the registration statement and prospectus used to effectuate the Company's initial public offering ("IPO"), Yatsen and the other named defendants misled investors into believing that Yatsen's most significant brands, Perfect Diary and Little Ondine, were thriving, thereby driving Yatsen's "healthy" top-line growth at the time of its IPO and quarter after quarter thereafter. In truth, however, cosmetic and skincare sales of Perfect Diary and Little Ondine products were declining in the period leading up to (and including at the time of) the IPO and throughout 2021. Moreover, as the truth about Yatsen's business reached the market, the value of the Company's shares declined dramatically, causing Yatsen investors to suffer significant damages.
WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Yatsen during the relevant time frame, you have until November 22, 2022  to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.
NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.
WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases.

JAKARTA, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Bali, Indonesia for the Group of 20 (G20) summit on Monday after which he addressed the summit on Tuesday, saying that faced with challenges, all countries should embrace the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, and advocate peace, development and win-win cooperation. 
This is not the first time that the president has spoken in Indonesia about international cooperation.
In a speech to Indonesian parliament on October 3, 2013, Xi said that in order to build a new "Maritime Silk Road," China will strengthen maritime cooperation with ASEAN countries " to make good use of the China-ASEAN Maritime Cooperation Fund set up by the Chinese government."
The Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road initiative (BRI) that Xi proposed aims to create a trade and infrastructure network that connects Asia with Europe and Africa along ancient trade routes both over land and sea. 
The history and culture of the Maritime Silk Road has long captured the imagination of the public in China, leading to the establishment of related museums, such as the Maritime Silk Road Museum in South China's Guangdong Province.
Ancient glory
Thousands of years ago, China and other countries were connected by the ancient Maritime Silk Road that got its start during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770BC-256BC), matured during the Han Dynasty (206BC-AD220) and flourished during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). Seen as the world's most ancient maritime route, the Maritime Silk Road was one of the most important sea passages for trade and cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries in ancient times.
Between China and Indonesia, the ancient Maritime Silk Road has played a great role in trade and cultural exchanges. Since the Tang Dynasty, China saw great progress in trade, shipbuilding and the maritime industry. The development of active overseas exchanges allowed trade relations between China and other nations in the region around what is today Indonesia flourish.
Indonesia's special location and numerous islands made it an important transit point along the Maritime Silk Road and distribution center for goods from China and other regions including Europe, South Asia and West Asia.
In the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), Chinese mariner, explorer and diplomat Zheng He was commissioned by the Yongle Emperor to command seven expeditionary voyages, which ended up traveling to Southeast Asia, South Asia, West Asia and East Africa from 1405 to 1433.
Zheng's voyages enhanced official trade and communication between the Ming and the governments of other countries became more frequent. According to historical records, ancient kingdoms in Indonesia sent their envoys to present gifts to China more than 50 times during the Ming Dynasty.
Throughout the history of the Maritime Silk Road, Indonesia has always been "the only way that must be passed" along this sea route, Wang Jianxin, the first scholar in China to conduct overseas Silk Road research, told the Global Times.
By passing by this significant transfer point, Chinese traders planted the seeds for China's cultural presence in the Southeast Asian country.
"Especially the descendants of immigrants, many of them have a Chinese cultural background, especially Southern Chinese, who moved to Indonesia centuries ago."
In the eyes of Chinese cultural researcher Xiao Shuming, such an early cultural transformation along the Maritime Silk Road paved the way for contemporary China and Indonesia to understand each other.
"Because of the ancient Maritime Silk Road, Indonesia is now the home to the largest number of overseas Chinese. But this isn't just a number, when people migrate, their lifestyles, traditions and beliefs migrate too," Xiao said.
BRI creates more opportunities
Based on the centuries of exchanges between the two nations through the Maritime Silk Road, cooperation between China and Indonesia has only increased and deepened today. As two important BRI countries, cooperation between Indonesia and China has been upgraded in the areas of politics, economics, culture and education, far beyond the simple exchange of light commodities in ancient times.
According to experts, relations between China and Indonesia are becoming more closely aligned and as trade between the two countries rises, so too do exchanges of culture.
This deepening cooperation has also brought an increasing demand for language talents, which has inspired young people from both nations to seek out more opportunities for cultural communication, experts noted.
Take current Silk Road e-commerce platforms as an example. In Indonesia, which has a huge number of millennials, around 63.5 million, there is a huge demand for e-commerce.
"The establishment of Silk Road e-commerce platforms has provided more opportunities for cooperation between citizens in the two countries, especially among young customers," Indonesian sinologist Novi Basuki told the Global Times.
The publics have been benefiting from China-Indonesia collaboration under the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road Initiative in recent years, Paulus Rudolf Yuniarto, a researcher from the Research Center for Area Studies, told the Global Times.
"Infrastructure investments made through the initiative, such as roads and seaports, directly benefit them by increasing their income, while investments by Chinese smartphone firms into technological infrastructure and e-commerce in Indonesia help employ many people," the researcher said.
Experts are optimistic about the future development of the 21st Maritime Silk Road. Yuniarto noted that the initiative indicates a development trend in economic, social and cultural fields. Chinese investment through the Belt and Road Initiative in Indonesia can reach a new level, as can bilateral relations based on equality, harmony, and mutual benefit.

Full text: STOCKHOLM, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Catena Media plc Interim Report January – September 2022
Highlights
- Revenue rose 11 percent in the fast-growing North American market in Q3, led by the launch of licensed online sports betting in Kansas and a strong NFL season start. Group revenue decreased by 2 percent.
- Solid growth in established markets contributed to a 43 percent increase in North American sports revenue when excluding the Arizona (Q3 2021) and Kansas launches.
- As part of the expanded strategic review announced in August, restructuring measures unlocked combined annualised cash savings in Europe of EUR 5.5m, higher than the initial target of EUR 5m. The savings, which included a 25 percent reduction in European headcount, will be fully effective from Q1 2023.
- Various grey-market performance marketing assets were divested during Q3 as part of the strategic review. From Q4 onwards, this will positively impact the European gross margin and EBITDA margin, while reducing revenue.
- The company is in advanced discussions over specific asset divestments as it evaluates multiple options for certain parts of the business subject to the strategic review. External advisors have been engaged to support this process, which remains ongoing.
- In October, revenue from North American sports betting and casino increased by 20 percent compared to October 2021. Total group revenue decreased by 1 percent excluding divested assets.                 

July–September 2022
- Revenue was EUR 32.3m (33.1), a decrease of 2 percent.
- Revenue in North America increased by 11 percent to EUR 18.6m (16.8), equivalent to 58 percent (51) of group revenue.
- Organic growth was -4 percent, or -3 percent excluding the German sports betting and casino market.
- New depositing customers (NDCs) totalled 116,746 (153,701), a decrease of 24 percent.
- Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 29 percent to EUR 11.7m (16.4), corresponding to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 36 percent (50). The decrease reflected continued strong growth-oriented investment into the fast-expanding North American market.
- EBITDA, including items affecting comparability of EUR 13.2m (1.5), totalled EUR -1.5m (14.9), reflecting European restructuring costs and a EUR 12.8m loss on disposal of grey-market performance marketing assets. The EBITDA margin was -5 percent (45).
- Earnings per share totalled EUR -0.08 (-0.51) before dilution and EUR -0.05 (-0.34) after dilution.
- Cash and cash equivalents were EUR 28.3m (28.6) on 30 September.
- Outstanding shares totalled 76,323,995 and the number of outstanding warrants was 33,767,877 on 30 September.

January–September 2022
- Revenue was EUR 106.4m (104.2), an increase of 2 percent.
- Revenue in North America increased by 22 percent to EUR 63.0m (51.4), equivalent to 59 percent (49) of group revenue.
- Organic growth was -8 percent, or -6 percent excluding the German sports betting and casino market. 
- New depositing customers (NDCs) totalled 424,476 (451,272), a decrease of 6 percent.
- Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 18 percent to EUR 46.3m (56.6), corresponding to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 44 percent (54).
- EBITDA, including items affecting comparability of EUR 15.3m (5.7), decreased by 39 percent to EUR 31.0m (50.9), mainly due to European restructuring costs and a EUR 12.8m loss of disposal on grey-market performance marketing assets. The EBITDA margin was 29 percent (49).
- Earnings per share were EUR 0.22 (-0.18) before dilution and EUR 0.15 (-0.12) after dilution.
- Cash and cash equivalents totalled EUR 28.3m (28.6) on 30 September.
- Catena Media repurchased 1,973,000 of its ordinary shares for EUR 8.6m and held 5.6 percent of all total outstanding shares on 30 September.
- Outstanding shares totalled 76,323,995 and the number of outstanding warrants was 33,767,877 on 30 September.                 

Significant events after the period
- Pre-live marketing campaigns signed with operators in Maryland and Ohio prior to projected launches of licensed sports betting in Q4 and/or Q1.
- The company is in advanced discussions over specific asset divestments as it evaluates multiple options for certain parts of the business subject to the strategic review. Depending on the outcome of the strategic review, certain assets' carrying value or useful life may need to be adjusted.
- In October, revenue from North American sports betting and casino increased by 20 percent compared to October 2021. Total group revenue decreased by 1 percent excluding divested assets.

CEO Michael Daly's comments
Q3 was a healthy quarter for Catena Media in which we again reported strong growth in our core North American business. Revenue in North America reached EUR 18.6m, an increase of 11 percent from Q3 last year, which was an extremely strong quarter that saw the legalisation of online sports betting in the large Arizona market and the nationwide launch of a large operator. Excluding the Arizona opening and also the successful onboarding of Kansas in Q3, North American revenue was up 24 percent overall and rose 43 percent in sports.
For the group, revenue decreased slightly and the EBITDA margin narrowed. I am nevertheless encouraged by our overall performance given macroeconomic challenges in multiple markets, our heavy growth-oriented investments in North America, and considering the internal engagement that the ongoing strategic review demanded from the business throughout the period.
The strategic review is nearing completion at the time of writing. Certain assets are currently in a divestment phase. Amid significant interest from multiple parties, this process is being managed by an external adviser and is approaching a conclusion. I look forward to making a fuller announcement in the near future.
The measures being taken, and to be taken, as part of the strategic review are optimising the business to capitalise on the growth of online sports betting and casino in North America, where a wave of regulation continues to open new markets to licensed operators and create exciting openings for Catena Media. Other future opportunities include Latin America and esports, both of which offer high potential for profitable growth over the longer term.
In Europe – the region where the current high-inflation environment is most pronounced and the squeeze on player spending is most acute – we scaled back our operations during the quarter to focus on a smaller core of strategic high-margin brands primarily in regulated online sportsbook markets, and to a lesser extent in casino. The key brands offer stable near-term growth potential and are located in the UK and Italy.
The restructuring measures led to a reduction in European headcount of more than 25 percent and generated combined annualised savings of EUR 5.5m. These savings, which were above our initial target of EUR 5m, will apply in full from January 2023. The reorganisation inevitably consumed a great deal of operational energy during the period, so I was especially pleased to see positive signs in Q3 from the new European core, led by solid growth in our Italian online sports betting business. I look forward to developing our high-performance Italian and UK assets as we move ahead.
The restructuring has also seen us offload certain grey-market assets as we transition fully into an organisation focused on the Americas and other regulated and stable markets. It is here that the appetite for supporting and extending licensed online sports betting and casino is strongest, and hence where we will be best placed to retain our market leadership and achieve high levels of sustainable growth over time.
In North America, the Kansas launch in September coincided with a successful start to the new NFL season and met our expectations for player engagement. Credit for this goes to our North American team, in which we have invested heavily both in terms of personnel and technology. This ongoing commitment positions us to take full advantage of forthcoming launches and will also provide a springboard to grow in our established markets. Three states – Maryland, Ohio and Massachusetts – have all announced their intention to legalise online sports betting in the near future, with Ohio committing to 1 January 2023 as its go-live date. We have advanced plans in place for these states, including operator collaborations in Ohio and Maryland that are already offering pre-live player deals. We continue on our path to surpassing our target of USD 100m in annual revenue.
The Q3 figures benefited from the launches earlier this year in New York, Louisiana and Ontario and in Connecticut in Q4 2021. New York slowed in Q3 after a highly successful launch in Q1 amid advertising pullback by operators in response to high tax rates. Inflationary pressures and cost-of-living increases may also have impacted on player spend. Nevertheless, New York has proven a very healthy business for us and will remain so going forward.
Our strength and expertise in organic search has already made Catena Media the leading affiliate for online sports betting and casino in North America. We see no reason why this remarkable growth story should not continue. High player values and public enthusiasm for online sports betting and casino are projected to support high margins for the foreseeable future. And as the market gradually shifts towards maturity in terms of state launches, we believe that operator-side activities and the development and refinement of our affiliate offerings will preserve healthy growth rates even in established markets. Diversifying into media partnerships such as our NJ.com venture with Advance Local, which we announced this quarter, will also provide new revenue streams – albeit at lower margins than our cost-per-acquisition activities – as we move forward. Here, we intend to select our partners carefully to ensure that such deals are revenue-enhancing and take our business forward.
Once the strategic review is behind us, I look forward to the organisation redoubling its focus on the highly promising Latin American market. I fully expect that we will soon begin to see this dynamic region take on a significant role in our Americas story. Another exciting area is esports, where our Esports.net brand reported exceedingly rapid user growth in Q3 and where I see rich opportunities ahead.
We continue to build for the future, and do so from a position of unprecedented strength. Our low debt, strong cash flow, organic search know-how and lean organisation make Catena Media uniquely placed to set the pace in lead generation for online sports betting and casino – in North America and beyond.

Full text: Recent release "Immortal Tears" from Page Publishing author Cameron Box is a mesmerizing novel that introduces Mae, who finds her home has been shattered, leaving her alone and orphaned.
NEW YORK, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Cameron Box, a resident of Georgia in a small town outside Atlanta, Newnan, has completed his new book "Immortal Tears": a gripping and potent novel that follows Mae as she figures out what to do next as everything she knows and loves is destroyed.
Author Cameron Box feels like writing is his passion, and this first book is a labor of love. He is family-oriented and enjoys time at home relaxing with his parents or going out to eat. He also loves gaming and getting together with friends for an occasional card game that might have a friendly wager involved. Cameron truly poured hours into this book and hopes that readers can identify with the characters and come to love them as much as he does.
Author Cameron Box writes, "An ebony bird darted across the sky as a beautiful sunrise was dancing with it. The morning air opened up to smoke as the bird flew down into the cobble streets below to peck at forgotten food. The sounds of wagons and beasts of burden could be seen working as the bird fluttered back into the sky. It watched with its silver peepers. The ivory gaze of the ebony bird turned to see old, worn buildings puff out chimney smoke as people could be heard chatting and trading down below in the market square. The bird landed on a statue in the market square of a woman holding holly and a branch of willow. The bird took off once more as it watched the people laugh and chat about the lovely, warm morning. The dark bird then flew outward to the large orchards of apples and oranges that lay on the outskirts of the town. The black bird landed on a window of a well-used Baltic thatch and timber house that is centered on the side of the orchard road. The bird looked into the window with curious eyes as it began to chirp. Loud rustling could be heard as a young girl was tumbling toward the window like a fury in a snowstorm."
Published by Page Publishing, Cameron Box's engrossing tale invites readers to join Mae on an incredible journey.
Readers who wish to experience this compelling work can purchase "Immortal Tears" at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes Store, Amazon, Google Play, or Barnes and Noble.

Full text: "Love Put Me In - Love Got Me Out" from Christian Faith Publishing author James Blurton is a compelling detective tale that will have readers racing to see who really murdered Luke Hampton.
MEADVILLE, Pa., Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- "Love Put Me In - Love Got Me Out": a gripping fiction with some unexpected twists of fate. "Love Put Me In - Love Got Me Out" is the creation of published author James Blurton.
Blurton shares, "In the early 1930s, in southern Georgia, young Billy was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for the murder of Luke Hampton, a crime young Billy did not commit. During his first years in prison he trained the warden's tracking hounds, and with the help of his favorite hound, Ole Red, Billy escaped and made his way to northern Idaho.
"After many years of worrying about being caught and wondering who had committed the murder, he told his grandson, Trey, a retired detective, about his past and how he had escaped from prison with the help of Ole Red. Even though the murder had been committed in the 1930s, Trey told his grandfather Bill he would go to Georgia and try to find out who committed the murder. Trey got more than he bargained for when during his investigation of the old murder, he uncovered crime and corruption that had been going on for decades in his grandfather's old hometown of Hardwood, Georgia. Trey's investigation brought to light the person who murdered Luke Hampton so many years earlier and it was a shock and total surprise to him and his grandfather Bill."
Published by Christian Faith Publishing, James Blurton's new book will delight the imagination as readers work to tease out what could have happened all those years ago in a sleepy Southern town.
Blurton brings a charming cast of characters to life within the pages of this enjoyable mystery adventure.

SANTIAGO, Chile, Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) (NYSE: SQM; Santiago Stock Exchange: SQM-B, SQM-A) reported today earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, of US$2,755.3 million (US$9.65 per ADR), an increase from US$263.9 million (US$0.92 per ADR) for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.
Gross profit  reached US$4,094.8 million (54.0% of revenues) for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, higher than US$547.3 million (30.8% of revenues) recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Revenues totaled US$7,577.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, representing an increase of 326% compared to US$1,778.0 million reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.
The Company also announced earnings for the third quarter of 2022, reporting net income of US$1,099.9 million (US$3.85 per ADR) compared to US$106.1 million (US$0.37 per ADR) for the third quarter of 2021. Gross profit for the third quarter of 2022 reached US$1,632.7 million, higher than the US$224.8 million recorded for the third quarter of 2021. Revenues totaled US$2,958.3 million, an increase of approximately 347% compared to the third quarter of 2021, when revenues amounted to US$661.6 million.  
SQM's Chief Executive Officer, Ricardo Ramos, stated: "We are very pleased with our results for the first nine months of the year. We have believed in the lithium market for many years, and as a result of this, we have invested heavily in R&D and have quickly expanded capacity. During the first nine months of the year, we were successfully able to surpass our internal production goals in the business and our sales volumes in the third quarter were the highest we have ever reported. In addition, lithium prices continued to increase throughout the third quarter. Our earnings reached record highs as a result of the positive market conditions mentioned above and the investments and risks SQM undertook over the past years, letting us contribute more than US$3.6 billion to the public coffers due our operations during the first nine months of the year, which includes more than US$2.3 billion related to the successful public-private alliance with CORFO."
He continued by saying, "Deepening our commitment with developing a sustainable lithium industry in Chile, during the third quarter we announced our plans related to the Salar Futuro project . We believe that this plan will be beneficial for all stakeholders, and we look forward to working with all of them to reduce our footprint further than our previously announced goals by using innovation, new technologies such as Advanced Evaporation Technologies (AET), Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) and by increasing yields and using of sea water. The Salar Futuro project implies important technological challenges, and investments for more than US$1.5 billion, that would allow us to have, here in Chile, the most sustainable mining operation in the world. The initial tests allow us to be optimistic; these are fundamental changes in the technologies and processes currently. These plans could positively change the way lithium mining is done globally and that makes us very proud." 
He added, "We continue to see strong signals regarding the future demand growth of lithium. This year we believe demand growth will be over 40% when compared to last year and for this reason we continue to invest in new projects. In September, we announced the purchase and development of a new plant in China, that will let us produce up to 30,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide in China, from lithium sulfate coming from Chile. In addition to this, today, the board of Directors approved the first stages to expand our lithium hydroxide capacity from 40,000 metric ton to 100,000 metric ton in Chile. This expansion will require a total investment of an additional US$360 million to the previously announced capex plan and should be in full operation by 2025. Both projects will allow us to have the flexibility to respond to future market needs while keep on adding value to the Salar de Atacama operation."
He closed by saying, "Finally, during the past few months, we have signed long term contracts for both lithium and iodine, proving our commitment to our businesses and the mutual trust and collaboration that we have with the main players in the industries in which we operate".

Full text: Guillaume Bertrand, Senior Communications Advisor and Press Secretary, Office of the Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos, Minister of Health, 613-957-0200; Media Relations, Health Canada, 613-957-2983, media@hc-sc.gc.ca; Public Inquiries: 613-957-2991, 1-866-225-0709
OTTAWA, ON, Nov. 16, 2022 /CNW/ - Today marked the conclusion of the 2022 National Autism Conference. Hosted by the Public Health Agency of Canada, the virtual event took place over two days and brought together federal, provincial, and territorial officials, Autistic individuals, their families and caregivers, advocates, Indigenous Peoples, and stakeholders to inform the development of a national autism strategy.
The discussions built on the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences' engagement process and scientific evidence review that took place earlier in 2022 and will help prioritize areas for action for the strategy.
Topics discussed included meaningful employment; financial pressures that Autistic individuals and families face; physical and emotional safety; the evolving need for autism-inclusive supports related to housing and health human resources; considerations regarding equity, diversity and inclusion; and how current and ongoing research on autism could be supported to inform policy and program development.
Addressing the complex and diverse needs of Autistic populations in Canada requires a coordinated effort across all levels of government and service providers. The Government of Canada is working closely with Autistic communities to contribute to the shared goal of improving their health and well-being. The National Autism Conference is a key milestone on the road to developing a national autism strategy that is responsive to the needs of Autistic individuals, their families, and caregivers.
Quotes
"This conference plays an important role in improving the lives of Autistic communities by determining priority areas for the national autism strategy. The insightful lived experiences and professional leadership that was brought to the table these past two days will be crucial in guiding the development of the strategy. Together, we can contribute to meaningful improvements to the health and well-being of Autistic individuals, their families and caregivers, for years to come."
The Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos
Minister of Health
"It was a pleasure to launch this national conference dedicated to the development of a national autism strategy. By coming together, we can make sure that we are developing an inclusive and comprehensive strategy that reflects the best expert advice and the experiences of those with Autism."
Adam van Koeverden
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health
"Our government is committed to making Canada inclusive from the start. We are supportive of the hard work of the self-advocates, families, and organizations that have been at the forefront of making sure that the policy is as inclusive and equitable as possible. This conference is a major step in helping to improve the well-being of Canadians with Autism."
The Honourable Carla Qualtrough
Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion
Quick Facts  
- Autism (also referred to as autism spectrum disorder or ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition. Each individual on the autism spectrum is unique, and the term "spectrum" refers to the wide variation in Autistic individuals' strengths and challenges.
- It is estimated that 1 in 50 children and youth aged 1 to 17 years have been diagnosed with autism in Canada.
- There is growing evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures have had a negative impact on many Autistic people and their families and caregivers. Disrupted routines and restricted or reduced access to programming, services and activities has had, and continues to have, a negative impact.
- Over the last five years, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research has invested approximately $68 million in research on autism. This research is increasing our understanding of autism and guiding the development of innovative tools and more effective ways to support Canadians on the autism spectrum and their families.
- Budget 2021 provided PHAC with $15.4 million over two years, to work collaboratively with provinces, territories, families and stakeholders toward the creation of a national autism strategy. Continued collaboration and knowledge-sharing across sectors and disciplines will help improve our understanding of autism, and support the needs of Autistic Canadians, their families and caregivers.
- Budget 2018 allocated $20 million over five years to better support the needs of Autistic individuals, their families and caregivers. Through this investment, $9.1 million was allocated to establish the Autism Spectrum Disorder Strategic Fund to support community-based projects that pursue innovative program models, help reduce stigma, and integrate health, social and educational components to better serve the complex needs of Autistic Canadians and their families. $10.9 million was also allocated for Autism and Intellectual Disabilities Knowledge Exchange Network (AIDE Canada), which provides access to online resources, including an inventory of services, supports, employment opportunities and local programming for families across the country.

OTTAWA, ON , Nov. 16, 2022 /CNW/ - Immigration is not just good for our communities and our economy. It is essential. That is why the Government of Canada is working to welcome newcomers who bring the skills our economy needs to help address acute labour shortages across the country.
The Honourable Sean Fraser, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, today announced the implementation of the National Occupational Classification (NOC) 2021 for immigration programs managed under the Express Entry system. Using the new NOC categories will allow Canada to bring in global talent in high-demand sectors like health care, construction, and transportation.
Nurse aides, long-term care aides, hospital attendants, elementary and secondary school teacher assistants, and transport truck drivers are examples of some of the 16 occupations now included in Express Entry.
The NOC system is used to track and categorize all jobs in the Canadian labour market and is updated to reflect changes in the economy and in the nature of work. The changes to the NOC system support the Minister's commitment to expand pathways to permanent residency for temporary workers and international students, as more jobs will become eligible for the programs managed under Express Entry. Through this update, 16 occupations that were not previously eligible can now benefit from expanded pathways to permanent residency.
Quotes "We are using all of the tools at our disposal to tackle labour shortages, particularly in key sectors like health care, construction, and transportation. These changes will support Canadians in need of these services, and they will support employers by providing them with a more robust workforce who we can depend on to drive our economy forward into a prosperous future. I'm thrilled to announce expanded pathways to permanent residence in Canada for these in-demand workers." 
– The Honourable Sean Fraser, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship
"NOC 2021 is welcome news for Canadian employers, for newcomers to Canada ready to take on the jobs they are qualified for, and for a newly eligible group of workers who will now have an Express Entry path to permanent residency available to them. With these changes, we are better positioned to tackle labour shortages proactively and grow our economy with a stronger, skilled workforce." 
–The Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion
"The Canadian Support Workers Association (CANSWA) applauds this move to help ease the shortage of personal support workers in our health care system. Personal support workers provide the majority of the bedside nursing care to vulnerable Canadians across our nation and are in desperate need of assistance to ensure that basic patient care can be delivered. The CANSWA and our members welcome the help from these new Canadians and hope they find a rewarding new life in their new home." 
–Miranda Ferrier, CEO Canadian Support Workers Association
"Every sector of the Canadian economy relies on the trucking industry. Today's announcement by Minister Fraser will help secure supply chains—from agriculture to manufacturing—by providing trucking companies access to an international workforce that was not previously available to our sector." 
–Stephen Laskowski, President of Canadian Trucking Alliance
Quick facts - The National Occupational Classification (NOC) is the national reference for occupations in Canada. It provides a systematic classification structure that categorizes the entire range of occupational activity in Canada for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating occupational data for labour market information and employment-related program administration. Occupational information supports labour market and career intelligence, skills development, occupational forecasting, labour supply and demand analysis, employment equity, and numerous other programs and services.
- Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada uses NOC to determine and assess the occupational eligibility criteria under its temporary and permanent residency programs.
- Employment and Social Development Canada and Statistics Canada work together to update the NOC on an ongoing basis, with major reviews occurring every 10 years, to ensure it reflects the changing labour market. The review involves in-depth research, analysis, and assessment of the feedback received through consultations and occupational research. Input from the public and stakeholders is an integral part of the review process.

- payroll administrators
- dental assistants and dental laboratory assistants
- nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates
- pharmacy technical assistants and pharmacy assistants

LARGO, Fla., Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- ABC Fine Wine & Spirits (ABC), Florida's largest family-owned and operated wine and spirits retailer, opened its newest store in Largo on Wednesday, Nov. 16.

The new location will host an opening weekend celebration on Saturday, Nov. 19 with free wine and spirits sampling, 10% off all products from ABC's exclusive Sourced & Certified™ Collection and a rare Pappy Van Winkle raffle. The raffle is for the chance to purchase a bottle of Pappy Van Winkle (10 Year, 12 Year or 15 Year) or William Larue Weller at ABC's normal retail price.
These bourbons typically require ABC Vault access and are not regularly available anywhere because they have highly limited allocation around the country.

Purchase is not required to enter. Raffle winners may purchase a bottle that is remaining from the four when contacted. Entries and purchase must occur at this new Largo ABC location only.

Verana Health Developing Qdata MS, a Real-World Data, Curated Neurology Research Module for Multiple Sclerosis

Full text: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Verana Health ® —a digital health company elevating quality in real-world data (RWD)—today announced it is developing Qdata™ MS , a Neurology Qdata module that will be used to help advance clinical research and develop therapeutic strategies for treating patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The company made the announcement ahead of the CNS Summit 2022 (Nov. 17 to 20) in Boca Raton, Fla.
Neurology Qdata comprises quality, curated datasets documenting real-world disease data, treatments, and outcomes. Available through Verana Health's real-world evidence (RWE) service offerings, Qdata MS is being derived from the American Academy of Neurology's Axon Registry® . The Axon Registry, managed by Verana Health's VeraQ™ population health data engine, is one of the largest—and growing—real-world clinical data registries for neurology. As the Qdata MS module evolves through development, it is estimated to include de-identified, curated RWD from about 30,000 patients diagnosed with MS, one of the largest longitudinal multiple sclerosis datasets for research use.
MS impacts a person's brain, spinal cord and optic nerves, which comprise the central nervous system (CNS). This unpredictable disease causes a person's immune system to attack the CNS, disrupting signals to and from the rest of the body. Nearly 1 million people are living with MS in the U.S., according to a  2019 study  funded by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. That is more than twice the number from a national study in 1975. MS is nearly three times more common among women than men . 
Qdata MS provides quality insights into the patient population by applying artificial intelligence to the unstructured data found in clinical notes to help provide a more complete understanding of disease activity and clinical characteristics such as MS phenotype, Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) score, and clinical relapse. Using de-identified electronic health record (EHR) data, detailed diagnostic classification beyond international classification of diseases (ICDs), and a granular understanding of disease activity, researchers can gain a better understanding of the MS patient journey.
Curated, de-identified RWD from patients with MS can help offer insights into how patients are living with this disease and reacting to treatments.
"Qdata MS gives patients and their physicians the opportunity to contribute and lend their anonymized experiences to research and engages the broader neurology community to learn more about this disease," said Heather Moss, MD, PhD, associate professor at Stanford University and Verana Health medical advisor. "Qdata MS has the potential to provide a more granular view of the MS patient journey that is not easily found within structured EHR fields, medical claims, or pharmacy claims. The ability to bring meaning to unstructured, de-identified neurologist notes on tens of thousands of MS patients will provide a valuable new dataset to help researchers develop and study treatments for various MS patient cohorts."
The new curated RWD module will benefit life sciences research through:
- Clinical development. As MS treatments improve, Qdata MS can help optimize study design.
- HEOR and medical affairs. Qdata MS can help researchers understand and track the patient journey for treated and untreated MS patients, from diagnosis by phenotype through treatment and disease course.
- Commercialization. Qdata MS can help reveal treatment performance across Axon Registry practices, clinical characteristics, and more, as well as deliver market insights based on details extracted from unstructured clinical notes.

"Qdata MS will help support MS researchers in accessing insightful RWE and allow practices enrolled in the Axon Registry to potentially participate in or help influence groundbreaking clinical research," said Sujay Jadhav, CEO of Verana Health. "By making this de-identified data available, the American Academy of Neurology and Verana Health are enabling MS researchers to gain a better understanding of this disease and how it can be treated."
Verana Health is continually developing new Qdata modules to help deepen understanding about diseases, patient journeys, and to help physicians and life sciences organizations improve quality of care for patients. Verana Health's first neurology module, Qdata SMA, launched in April 2022. It provides a real-world, de-identified dataset reflective of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients found across healthcare settings. The company has plans to add Qdata modules for other neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's Disease, Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD), and more.

Full text: Eight elite players compete for a Guaranteed Rate PBA Tour title June 24-25 in Arlington, Washington
RICHMOND, Va., Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The top eight Guaranteed Rate PBA Tour professionals, as determined by competition points earned over the past two seasons, will return to Strikerz Bowling in the Angel of the Winds Casino in Arlington, Wash. for the 2022 PBA Tour Finals - featuring nine hours of live bowling on CBS Sports Network June 24 and 25.
The top point earners from the 2022 season through the 2023 PBA Players Championship in May will be divided into two groups for qualifying rounds broadcast live on June 24. The stepladder finals and championship match will air live on June 25.
Last year, eventual PBA Player of the Year Jason Belmonte won the PBA Tour Finals for his career-best fifth PBA Tour title of the season, bowling his second career televised perfect game in the process. Earlier in the event, Kyle Troup also bowled a 300 game, marking the first time two perfect games were bowled during a single PBA Tour Finals event.
"The Tour Finals is one of the hardest events to win and qualify for," Belmonte said. "I respect this event so much. Going back to defend my title at Strikerz Bowling is so exciting. The fans there love bowling and the massive crowds are proof of that. Plus, my ball seems to strike a little better there, which I won't complain about."
This is the seventh iteration of the PBA Tour Finals, which rewards the best bowlers over a two-year period with a chance to compete in the quest to earn a Guaranteed Rate PBA Tour title.

Forty-Seven Percent of Persons With Type 2 Diabetes Say a Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) Program Would Help Them Better Manage Their Health

Full text: TAMPA, Fla., Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The results of the Diabetes Care Survey, a longitudinal analysis of patients with Type 2 diabetes in the United States, have been released for 2022 and provide important insights into how remote patient monitoring (RPM) can benefit patients with chronic conditions. One of the most important findings was that 47 percent of patients surveyed said they would test their glucose more consistently if they knew the results were being transmitted to their provider.
And that 47 percent is an increase of 12 percent from last year's survey. This coincides with the fact that RPM has become more popular with both providers and patients because it increases patient adherence and can help improve outcomes.
Approximately 26 million Americans have Type 2 diabetes, but according to one study, about 45 percent of them don't adequately control their glucose levels. 1 Testing their glucose and knowing their reading on a regular basis can help people with Type 2 diabetes and their physician better manage their disease.
Still, many people with Type 2 diabetes only see their doctor once or twice a year. If the patient is solely responsible for writing down their readings for review by their physician during an office visit, there may be an issue with those readings.
"Written glucose logs, some research postulates, are inaccurate or falsified up to 50% of the time," said Ronald Tamler, MD, PhD, CDE, clinical director of the Mount Sinai Diabetes Center and associate professor of medicine at The Mount Sinai Medical Center. 2 "Having this specific information allows your care provider to treat your diabetes better. But with so little patients bringing what is probably the most important tool in their management of diabetes, what is a physician to do?"
With cellular-enabled remote glucose monitoring solutions, providers are assured of getting the latest and most accurate data when a patient tests. This can help identify trends, prevent hospitalization, and improve outcomes.
"When patients use a cellular-enabled glucose meter, they know their results are being sent immediately to their provider," said Dr. Bill Lewis, a national telemedicine consultant and prior Chair of the Telemedicine Accreditation Committee. "Smart Meter's iGlucose is powered by an exclusive 4/5G AT&T network so transmission of data is fast, accurate, and secure every time."

BAYTOWN, Texas, Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Explore illuminated castles and world landmarks, peek under the sea and step into imaginary lands of delight and adventure at Magical Winter Lights (MWL) near Houston. Encompassing more than seven dazzling themed displays and with more than six million lights, the 2022 MWL is held all holiday season from November 18, 2022, to January 7, 2023, including Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year's Eve, and New Year's Day at Houston Raceway in Baytown.
In 2022 MWL returns with even more excitement and experiences including, new lantern displays, a renovated castle entrance, and additional entertainment.
Circus Espana is one of the newest additions. This special attraction transports guests to a 1920s winter's tale in a faraway place where a magical clock that strikes once a year awakens a frozen town and brings sensational acts to life. From juggling challenges to aerial acrobats and a thrilling end, this bonus attraction, with an additional admission cost, is sure to entertain guests.
"We strive to top each year's experience with something even more magical, and I'm confident this year will be no exception," said Yusi An, founder and executive producer of MWL. "Our artists have added more creative and dynamic lanterns and reimagined festival favorites so that there is something new for everyone."
Artisans from Zigong, China, where lantern festivals originate, have reconstructed the seven lantern sections including a fan-favorite. This Chinese section explores ancient traditional Chinese art, the faith of wishing trees, and popular zodiac signs. Houston's diversity is not left out either with tributes paid to local culture and landmarks.
The Dino exhibit has moved outdoors, where dinosaurs belong, and MWL will introduce an all-new, indoor, Alice & Winterland experience that puts guests inside a whimsical world beyond imagination. The event also offers train rides, a carnival, shopping areas, and character entertainment. However, the jolly Saint Nick has been scared off and replaced by the Grinch. Guests can now enjoy photo opportunities with the Grinch, Cindy Lou, the Ice Sisters, a magical snowman, and a mystical mermaid at various locations throughout the event. Check the MWL website for appearance schedules for each character.
"We invite guests to take in this full Magical Winter Light experience throughout the holidays," said An. "With only 45 days that you can attend, now's the time to plan with friends and family for a date to make magical memories together."
Day-specific tickets are available online now and discounted prices are offered on any day tickets from more than 200 local area Walgreens.

TIGIT Inhibitors Overview
T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) is one of the most recently investigated immune checkpoints as an immunotherapeutic target. TIGIT is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor with an Ig-like V-type domain in its cytoplasmic domain and an ITIM in its extracellular domain. It is found on activated and memory T cells, as well as NK cells and Tregs. Binding to either of its two APC ligands, CD155 (PVR: poliovirus receptor) or CD112 (PVRL2, nectin-2), inhibits maturation and confers a tolerogenic phenotype.
TIGIT-blockade clinical trials in cancer have recently begun in large numbers, mostly as combination treatments. TIGIT-Fc fusion protein has been shown to interact with PVR on dendritic cells, increase IL-10 secretion/decrease IL-12 secretion in response to LPS stimulation, and inhibit T cell activation in vivo. Antibodies against TIGIT's interaction with PVR can block its inhibition of NK cytotoxicity, and the activity is directed through its ITIM domain.

Ociperlimab: BeiGene
BeiGene's Ociperlimab (BGB-A1217) is an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody with high specificity and affinity for TIGIT. Ociperlimab is a cutting-edge, developing anti-TIGIT antibody with an intact IgG Fc binding region for optimal antibody-mediated anti-tumor activity. Ociperlimab binds to TIGIT and prevents it from interacting with poliovirus receptor (CD155) and poliovirus receptor-related 2 (CD112) ligands on tumor cells, activating T cell-mediated antitumor immune responses.
BAT6005: Bio-Thera Solutions
BAT6005, developed by Bio-Thera Solutions, is a monoclonal antibody that targets TIGIT in cancer patient volunteers. BAT6005 was discovered using Bio-Thera's proprietary IDEAL (Intelligent Design and Engineered Antibody Libraries) platform, and it has normal IgG1 ADCC function.

INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- At a time of growing societal uncertainty about the value of higher education and declining enrollment, the views of alumni turn out to be particularly insightful. This group can provide especially valuable feedback about how their education experiences have enriched their lives, which can help us ensure that today's students maximize all the benefits that college offers.
In March and April of 2022 Strada conducted a nationally representative study of more than 3,200 alumni who completed bachelor's degrees since 2002. The findings are eye opening – alumni who report they developed key skills during college earned $8,700 more in their first year after graduation than their peers who report lower levels of skill development through college . They are also more likely to attribute life and career successes to their education experiences. These key skills included general, interpersonal, and specialized skills.
To help students get the greatest benefits from their education—earnings, careers, and quality of life—educators and policy makers can confidently focus on supporting students in developing skills that will improve their post-completion outcomes. While many already pursue this approach to serving students, the findings in this analysis of the 2022 Strada Outcomes Survey point students and educators alike to the power of ensuring that students develop—and recognize—valuable skills that equip them to get a good job, contribute to their communities, and develop a fulfilling life.
"Higher education has come a long way in being able to measure economic returns," said Dr. Nichole Torpey-Saboe, author of the report. "But we are only beginning to scratch the surface when it comes to understanding broader life outcomes. What I find so interesting about this research is that we can see the links between skills that alumni say they developed and both those economic and non-economic outcomes. And we see certain skills that rise to the top in terms of their connection with stronger post-completion outcomes. Our motivation for this research is really to uncover those key links that can help us all improve outcomes for students—especially those who face the most significant barriers."  
Another important thread to these findings was the understanding that equity gaps persist. Compared to men, women with bachelor's degrees are less likely to meet the $50,000 earnings threshold. And Black alumni are least likely to experience post-completion success, including earning at least $50,000 per year, feeling that their education helped them to achieve their goals, and feeling that their education was worth the cost. In addition, although self-reporting of skill development is associated with better non-economic outcomes for all students, strong reports of skill development are not associated with additional income gains for Black alumni.
"We should not assume that students have opportunities to develop critical thinking, problem solving, communication, teamwork and leadership, as well as specialized skills like data analysis and digital literacy associated with jobs in the 21 st century," said Dr. Ruth Watkins, President of Strada Impact. "These skills can be intentionally built into curricular and co-curricular experiences to serve all students so that each individual is prepared to fully and equitably succeed beyond the completion of their degree."
A complete report of the findings can be found here. 
Strada Education Network  is a national nonprofit dedicated to helping people take advantage of education and training after high school that helps them secure a good job, do meaningful work, contribute to their communities, and lead a fulfilling life. Strada helps students succeed beyond completion of a certificate or degree through its research, charitable grants, and social impact investments, as well as through the work of Strada-supported nonprofit organizations CAEL, Education at Work, InsideTrack, and Roadtrip Nation, which directly serve learners and workers.

Close to 400,000 uninsured and underinsured patients served by participating FQHCs in Texas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Florida, and Illinois can now receive specialty care eConsults, saving time and money for patients and providers and improving health outcomes for underserved patients.
MIDDLETOWN, Conn., Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- ConferMED, one of the nation's leading eConsult companies, announced today it is providing specialty eConsults to eligible Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in cities serving close to 400,000 uninsured and underinsured patients through a $2.3M grant from the Quest Diagnostics Foundation.  The grant is part of the foundation's Quest for Health Equity (Q4HE) initiative and is being provided to ConferMED's Advancing Health Equity Project to address a leading cause of health inequity: lack of access to specialty care. FQHCs in Miami, FL; Chicago, IL; Baltimore, MD; Houston, TX and Boston, MA are eligible for the program. To date, 15 health centers in the targeted regions have signed up for services.
To date, 15 health centers in the targeted regions have signed up for services. The Quest funding is enabling ConferMED specialists to consult virtually with primary care providers at these health centers to help quickly resolve specialty cases.  Specialty eConsults save patients and participating providers time and money, increase access to care in areas where specialty care services are limited, and improve health outcomes for underserved patients. 
"The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare health inequities in underserved communities primarily served by community health centers," says ConferMED President and Founder Daren Anderson, MD. "Fewer barriers to specialty care means better patient outcomes and ultimately a healthier community.  With this grant from the Quest Diagnostics Foundation, we are thrilled to be able to provide eConsult services to primary care providers at FQHCs in the Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Houston, and Miami metro areas."
ConferMED specialists are board certified in their field and fully credentialed to provide specialty care services to patients in these regions. They can support primary care providers with more than 40 adult and pediatric specialties. ConferMED has provided over 80,000 eConsults to primary care practices across the country. 
FQHCs currently signed up for this new grant-funded program are: Community Health of South Florida (CHI), Care Resource Community Health Center, Inc., The Center for Family and Child Enrichment and Borinquen Health Care Center, Inc. in Florida; TCA Health, Inc., and Prime Care Health and  Inner City Muslim Action Network in Illinois; Total Health Care, Inc., and Healthcare for the Homeless in Maryland; East Boston Neighborhood Health Center, and Uphams Corner Health Community in Massachusetts; and Houston Area Community Services dba Avenue 360, Healthcare for the Homeless, Lone Star Circle of Health, and Stephen F. Austin dba Community Health Network (CHN) in Texas.
Community Health of South Florida (CHI) was the first health center in the country to take advantage of the opportunity and has already fully implemented to support its 75,000 patients, according to Dr. Saint Anthony Amofah, Chief Medical Officer at CHI.
"We are excited for this opportunity to improve access to specialty care for all of our patients, regardless of health insurance or ability to pay," he said. "The ability to receive direction from specialists on how to provide the best, evidence-based care for our patients in primary care is valuable."
"With the help of ConferMED's eConsult services, we are able to enhance access to specialty care for patients while, at the same time, educating our providers about specialty care treatment," added Dr. Timothy Long, Chief Clinical Officer for Health Choice Network, a Miami-based health services organization supporting 43 safety-net provider organizations that include Community Health Centers of South Florida and two other participating FQHCs in metro Miami. "Providers at these health centers can now connect directly with specialists to help them manage complex patients in a seamless way that is as affordable, accessible, and culturally sensitive as their other services. Providers can also be assured that their patients are getting the specialty services they need to achieve optimal care outcomes." 
Quest for Health Equity (Q4HE) is a multi-year initiative of Quest Diagnostics (NYSE: DGX). The Quest Diagnostics Foundation focused on providing a combination of donated testing services, education programs, partnerships, and funding to support initiatives to close the gap in healthcare services and address disparities in underserved communities.
"We are proud of this important collaboration with ConferMED that will improve access to critical specialty care services in under-resourced communities," said Ruth Clements, President of the Quest Diagnostics Foundation. "We believe that these services will improve health outcomes and support wellness, which is more important than ever after many have deferred care due to the pandemic."

Full text: New laboratory to advance collaborations with area's research universities and scientific organizations
HOUSTON, Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Electrochemical Safety Research Institute (ESRI) of UL Research Institutes (ULRI) has launched a new laboratory in Houston to study renewable energy technologies designed to mitigate climate change.
"As the world transitions from fossil fuels to sustainable energy, we are working with research teams across several organizations to lay the scientific groundwork for safe and reliable energy storage alternatives," said Dr. Judy Jeevarajan, ESRI's executive director. "Since several of our research partners are based in Houston, the natural progression was to open our own laboratory in the area."
ESRI's new laboratory opened earlier this month within the University of Houston Technology Bridge (UHTB), a startup park adjacent to the university's main campus. ESRI's research scientists will explore the safety and performance limits of batteries and other renewable energy technologies, seeking ways to characterize and overcome the safety limitations and advance the UL Research Institutes commitment to address the global grand challenge of building resilience for a sustainable future.
"We are significantly expanding both our capacity and scope to better meet today's increasingly urgent safety challenges," said Dr. Christopher J. Cramer, ULRI's chief research officer. "Our new Houston facility is one element of that expansion. The lab will strengthen the synergies between ESRI and our research partners in the area and accelerate scientific discoveries to help create a safer, more sustainable world."
ESRI already collaborates with other Houston area researchers on several key projects. The Houston laboratory will enable ESRI to strengthen its academic collaborations with the University of Houston on hydrogen research, solid-state batteries, and the synthesis of magnesium-ion separators.
It will also facilitate ESRI's research partnership with Rice University on lithium-ion cell recycling and the research institute's work with NASA's Johnson Space Center on thermal runaway mitigation and micro-USB lithium-ion battery safety. ESRI also collaborates with Stress Engineering Services Inc. on research into thermal runaway propagation in lithium-based cell packages for the G-7 and the United Nations Informal Working Group.
"We're delighted to welcome the Electrochemical Safety Research Institute to its new home in Houston," said Dr. Chris Taylor, executive director of the Office of Technology Transfer and Innovation at the University of Houston. "Together, we can build upon our research culture of collaboration as we pursue innovations for the greater good."

Full text: ATLANTA, Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --  Au Vodka , UK's Number #1 super-premium & fastest growing brand, is pleased to announce its official entry into the US Market with the debut of the brand's signature Au Vodka Black Grape and Original Vodka flavors in three key initial markets: Georgia, Florida and Texas.
The UK's Number #1 Super-Premium & Fastest Growing Brand, Au Vodka, Officially Debuts in US The news comes on the heels of the company's recent announcement regarding their partnership with Speakeasy Co., a leading ecommerce and fulfillment platform servicing the beverage alcohol industry.
It has been nothing short of a whirlwind kick-off debut for the brand; in less than a month since having begun distribution in Georgia, the brand has already depleted 1000's of cases as well as generated over $1 Million in revenue in its first 10 days of launch.
"We are thrilled to have officially broken ground here in the United States, with the support of both our online partner of record, Speakeasy Co., as well as our traditional distributor partner-of-note: RNDC (Republic National Distributing Company)," states Dan Price, Sales Director of US for Au Vodka. "We have no doubt that Au Vodka will be a smashing success here in the States as it has been in the UK; our intention is to dominate the wider US landscape in the year(s) ahead by leveraging the successful playbook we've built to own the wider EU market."
"We are pleased to officially welcome Au Vodka to the RNDC portfolio," states Michael Ellinghaus, Vice President of Spirits, RNDC Georgia. Ellinghaus continues, "The Au team identified a notable opportunity within the global drinks market and quickly became the fastest growing brand in the UK. We look forward to working hand-in-hand with their team to bring Au Vodka to unchartered heights in 2022 and beyond, as we launch in Georgia and the entire US Market."
The brand has also partnered up with Total Wine & More , the nation's leading retailer of wine, spirits and beer, with presence in 80+ stores across the company's three initial markets.
Vodka has remained a steady mainstay in the market, however there has been increased demand for more premium products as well as a growing trend of flavored vodka. Au Vodka was started by Charlie Morgan and Jackson Quinn in 2016 in the UK when they saw a gap in the market for a luxury vodka brand. They were bored of receiving birthday presents of the same vodkas year after year and felt they could bring a more exciting vodka to market. Known for its eye-catching gold bottles and uniquely flavored vodkas, Au Vodka later saw investment from superstar DJ Charlie Sloth, who also helped build the brand's social following. They are now the most followed spirits brand on TikTok .
Since launch, Au Vodka has seen a growth in its e-commerce business of 10,000% in terms of online revenue growth, with its revenues now at over $6.7 million in 2022.
The brand's signature Black Grape and Original vodka flavors are priced at $39.99 per bottle and are available in GA, FL, TX in select Total Wine & More locations as well as on their company website .
Details on Black Grape
- Au has combined its award-winning recipe with the highest quality black grapes to create a sweet & unique vodka
- Blending the finest British black grapes with natural spring water from deep in the South Down hills
- Au Black Grape is sippable on the rocks, paired with lemonade or breathing character into any cocktail

Details on Original Flavor
- We combine our British heritage and luxury ingredients together to create a truly exceptional ultra-premium vodka
- Recognized instantly by our signature gold bottle, Au Vodka is for those who choose individuality over common feeling
- Au's signature smooth taste and distinct flavoring is perfect on the rocks or in a martini, breathing character into any cocktail

About Au Vodka Au Vodka was founded in 2016 by Jackson Quinn and Charlie Morgan, two schoolmates from Wales in the UK. Au Vodka stood out from the crowd with its one of a kind gold bottle & crazy unique flavored & colored vodkas.
Au Vodka's turnover grew from $1 million to $54 million in the last two years with its ecommerce business boasting a 10,000% online revenue growth, jumping from $30k in 2019 to more than $6.7 million in 2022.

First of its kind capabilities democratizes speedy and secure data access to structured and unstructured file data 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Okera , a leader in Universal Data Authorization, today announced the immediate availability of OkeraEnsemble™, a comprehensive file control solution that extends secure data access management for tabular data and multi-structured files within the same policy with native scaling on Amazon EMR. With OkeraEnsemble, analysts/engineers and business/low-code data users have swift access to tabular and file-based data at massive scale using a single coherent collaborative platform. As part of Okera's mission to democratize data for all users so they can safely and securely access data across cloud, hybrid and on-premise sources, OkeraEnsemble protects sensitive data and ensures privacy by managing data access without having to use different tools for both files and tables.
To learn more, read a comprehensive whitepaper , or sign up to meet in person at AWS re:Invent 2022 here .
"With OkeraEnsemble, FINRA can look to enable self-service data analytics by providing highly secure access to a wide variety of structured and unstructured data through latest generation analytical platforms," said Pragnya Gandhi, Senior Principal Architect at FINRA. "And, we can envision protecting the data from our enterprise data lake and gain the benefits of centralized entitlement policies and audit trails across hundreds of petabytes of data without having to write complex identity access management policies."
OkeraEnsemble enables users to define attribute-based access control within the Okera Dynamic Access Platform through a single unified source and access unstructured data, such as documents, images, video, and audio files stored as files on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) from Amazon Web Services (AWS). Unlike traditional offerings, OkeraEnsemble on Okera nScale™ with Amazon EMR – currently in beta with select customers – delivers the full spectrum of data access management to ensure that data is fully protected, allowing users to leverage the rich types of data needed for analytic and data science use cases while reducing the work typically required to transform the data to a structured format.
"Most data access governance products do a fine job of controlling access to structured data, but they ignore the fact that cloud computing's biggest benefit, separation of store and compute, is to allow authorized users to reach the underlying files directly," said Nong Li, Founder and CEO of Okera. "OkeraEnsemble enables users to tag files containing structured or unstructured data as sensitive and leverage the policies meant to control access to structured data stores and files and dynamically enable access to only authorized users or groups to list, copy or view files. Okera helps remove the challenges typically posed by identity-based access management, as policies are consistently enforced across all the access methods that data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers might want to employ, including Amazon S3 REST APIs, AWS Command Line Interface, Apache Spark on Amazon EMR, or Databricks."
Highlights and unique features of OkeraEnsemble include:
- Progressive Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC): Provides better data security and faster compliance, creates massive economies of scale, and ensures consistency in policy enforcement. Allows users to classify files and folders, leverage tags in file access controls and utilize advanced Okera functionality, such as applying user attributes or defining time-bound conditions for permissions. Configurations can be made using an easy-to-use point-and-click user interface or by leveraging Okera APIs.

- Infinite nScale™: Handles enormous amounts of users and supports large volumes of data access requests via Okera's pattern for tabular data access enforcement. Allows organizations to fully leverage their existing compute infrastructure and achieve elasticity at no additional cost for access control of both tabular data and file data, while ensuring consistent policy enforcement and auditing.

"Strategic companies like Okera are providing a tremendous value-add for our customers who rely on Amazon EMR for petabyte-scale data processing, interactive analytics, and machine learning using open-source frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, and Presto," said Mehul Shah, general manager, Amazon EMR at AWS. "Thanks to solutions like OkeraEnsemble on Amazon EMR, our customers can accelerate time to value with Amazon EMR and Amazon SageMaker by leveraging both structured and unstructured Amazon S3 data files quickly and easily while ensuring security and governance at scale that work well with existing AWS services."

Delsym Uncovers the Key for Families this Cold & Flu Season: Cozying Up and Watching Your Favorite Feel-Better Movie

Full text: The #1 Pediatrician Recommended 12-Hour Cough Medicine Launches New Campaign to Help Families Feel Better Together
PARSIPPANY, N.J., Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Any parent knows that as soon as one person in the house comes down with something, odds are the rest of the family is next. It's just a matter of who and when. And if there's one thing we've learned over the past few years, it's that nothing rallies a family like being sick…and getting well together. This cough & cold season, Delsym – a Reckitt brand and the #1 pediatrician recommended 12-hour cough medicine – is reminding families about the importance of feeling better together, and that sometimes all you really need is a cozy blanket, a cup of warm soup and your favorite feel good… no, make that feel better movie.
To launch the brand's "Feel Better Together" campaign, Delsym conducted a nationwide OnePoll survey* to uncover what Americans turn to for comfort when they're home sick. While it's no surprise that the average parent watches up to five hours of TV or movies per sick day, more than half of survey respondents said they have a favorite feel-better movie they've watched more than 30 times, including films like Harry Potter, Shrek, Frozen, Toy Story, Marvel Universe movies and more. But these flicks aren't the only go-to sick day essentials; about 40% shared that snuggling up with their favorite blanket on the living room couch also helps them feel better.
Inspired by these insights, Delsym has teamed up with Cameo, the leading marketplace connecting talent with fans and brands, to tap a handful of stars from America's favorite feel-better shows and movies to surprise 12 families with a "Feel Better" Cameo video message. Jodie Sweetin, known for her role as Stephanie Tanner on the ABC comedy series Full House and its bingeable Netflix sequel series Fuller House, is just one of the stars joining in on the feel-better fun.
Delsym is working with the Boys & Girls Clubs of Union County in New Jersey to identify 12 families who will receive an exclusive sick day care package from Delsym. Each care package will include an Apple iPad to watch their personalized Cameo video, a cozy blanket for mom and dad, a popcorn machine to keep the kids' hunger at bay, Delsym products and more – these custom care packages were designed to help families feel better physically and emotionally.
"As a health brand, we know that families need Delsym's 12-hour relief just as much as they need comforting remedies like mom's chicken soup, watching a feel better movie or snuggling with your kids," said Albert So, Marketing Director, Upper Respiratory Brands at Reckitt. "As we head into another unpredictable cold & flu season, we hope to continue providing families everywhere with the long-lasting relief they need, while reminding them we'll help them feel better every step of the way."
To continue supporting the local New Jersey community where Reckitt's Regional Headquarters are based, Delsym is making a $20,000 donation to the Boys & Girls Clubs of Union County, helping its young members continue living a healthy lifestyle and reach their fullest potential.

*Survey Methodology:  This random double-opt-in survey of 2,000 U.S. millennial parents of kids aged 4 – 12 was commissioned by Delsym between October 6 and October 10, 2022. It was conducted by market research company OnePoll, whose team members are members of the Market Research Society and have corporate membership to the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) and the European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research (ESOMAR).

Full text: PLYMOUTH and BALATON, Minn., Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today Chitogen Inc., a medical hemostat manufacturer and trū ® Chitosan, a division of The trū ® Shrimp Companies, Inc., jointly announced the signing of a Letter of Intent for the supply of trū Chitosan for use in the market expansion of Chitogen's patented and proprietary SoftSeal ® interventional hemostat product line into the European Union and for continued development work and trials of trauma and surgical hemostats.
"This is truly a great development for Chitogen," stated Albert Emola, President of Chitogen. "trū Chitosan is made in the US in an FDA facility to exact USP [United States Pharmacopeia] monograph specifications. Their extraordinary, documented chain of custody will enable Chitogen to market our SoftSeal interventional hemostats into the very demanding regulatory environment of the European Union. This is a strategic priority for Chitogen, Inc."
"trū Chitosan's focus is on the medical applications of chitosan, and we are honored to be selected by Chitogen to be part of their future plans," stated Michael Ziebell, President and CEO of The trū Shrimp Companies, Inc., producers of trū Chitosan. "Chitogen's proprietary technology makes a difference to patients, and we are excited to be part of their expansion into the EU and aid in their further development of trauma and surgical hemostats." 
"trū Chitosan's complete chain of custody is a critical element," added Dr. James Drake, Chief Science Officer of Chitogen. "To obtain CE approval requires a precise, documented chain of custody and trū Chitosan's is unmatched. trū Chitosan also enables our planned expansion into trauma and surgical hemostats for all markets. Production in the United States is very much a bonus."
Chitosan is a natural polymer extracted and purified from the exoskeleton or shell of crustaceans. Unlike other chitosan producers, trū Chitosan has a documented chain of custody from shrimp postlarvae to purified chitosan. trū Chitosan is made from the shells of the shrimp grown in trū Shrimp's Tidal Basin® controlled environment, free of disease, antibiotics and pollution. This ensures the quality and consistency of the original shell tissue and complete traceability for each lot of chitosan. The controlled indoor environment where the shrimp are grown is constantly monitored to ensure optimal growth and shrimp health conditions. The shrimp shell tissue is then harvested, preserved and further refined to produce chitosan that meets the high standards of USP. trū Chitosan not only provides a USP conforming Certificate of Analysis, but also a Certificate of Origin that documents the chain of custody from shrimp postlarvae to finished medical application chitosan.
ABOUT CHITOGEN, INC.: Chitogen Inc. produces high quality hemostatic products using a proprietary surface treatment to enhance the efficacy of chitosan.

Full text: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Big Sunday , one of the USA's foremost organizations connecting people through egalitarian helping and volunteering opportunities will host its 11th Annual BIG Thanksgiving Stuffing Event – a Festival of Gratitude on Wednesday, November 23 rd from 9 AM – 12 Noon at Baldwin Hills Elementary School, 5421 Obama Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90016. On the day before Thanksgiving, more than 1,500 volunteers of all ages, races, ethnicities, religions, genders, socio-economic backgrounds and political affiliations from across Southern California will unite to enjoy each other's company while working to sort food, and stuffing and handing out the bags of food to kick off the holiday season. Many of the participants helping will also be receiving assistance underscoring Big Sunday's belief that the world isn't divided into the "haves" and the "have nots." Rather, the world is full of the "haves" and the "have mores" – everyone, regardless of personal circumstance, has some way in which they can help someone else, a message that is resounding this year more than ever in light of such challenging economic times for so many. Big Sunday plans to give away over 3,000 bags of Thanksgiving food to thousands of families, including victims of domestic violence, runaway teens, seniors, veterans, working poor families, homeless people, ailing people and many others. Everyone participating is also invited to join in for a big community breakfast for all participants hosted by Big Sunday. All participants 5 and up must be vaccinated.
The response to this year's event, particularly at such a polarized and economically difficult time in the USA, has been remarkable. "Between recipients, volunteers, food collectors, donors, vendors, and everyone else, this one event will touch more than 15,000 nice people of every age, from all walks of life. For all that, I am very grateful," said David Levinson, Big Sunday's founder and executive director, and author of Everyone Helps, Everyone Wins, How Absolutely Anyone Can Pitch In. Help Out. and Give Back. to Make the World a Better Place .  Considered an expert in the field of volunteerism, Levinson is consulted widely by cities, nonprofits, corporations and other volunteer organizations. A host of individuals and groups, including schools, religious institutions, businesses, non-profits and families from across Southern California are already participating by collecting and dropping off hundreds of pounds of food, sponsoring the event, sponsoring individual bags of food via the Big Sunday website, making cards to be included with each bag, signing up to volunteer at the event and collecting hundreds of dollars to be put toward food in preparation for the event. 
Big Sunday (www.bigsunday.org) has been connecting people with opportunities to help, volunteer and to do good works together since 1999. Founded in Los Angeles 23 years ago by David Levinson with just 300 volunteers, Big Sunday has touched over a 1 million lives, engaging, empowering and uniting people of every imaginable background all over California, from San Diego to San Francisco, and in more than 20 different states as well as Australia and the UK.

Big Sunday produces, promotes or sponsors over 2000 unique helping opportunities every year, which engage, empower, and unite people of every age, background and means to work together to support the huge variety of  causes that they care about . Big Sunday's mission is to connect people and build community via helping and is driven by the belief that  absolutely everyone has some way that they can help someone else .

Full text: The world-famous Striptease club has become the first-ever topless bar to be included in the Small Business Commission's legacy business list.
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Condor Club, a historic topless entertainment venue in the North Beach community, has been named among the newest inductees to the San Francisco Small Business Commission's Legacy Business program. The program was created to celebrate businesses that have contributed to the city's history or identity in a meaningful way, while also maintaining continuous operation for 30 years or more.
The bar and entertainment club was nominated by Aaron Peskin, the District 3 Supervisor that represents North Beach. As Peskin stated, the Condor Club has been "a seminal part of the North beach landscape for many, many decades, and it's synonymous with San Francisco." After a public hearing and review of historical documentation, the San Francisco Historic Preservation Commission provided their professional recommendation that the Condor Club was a qualified candidate for the Legacy Business Registry.
Visitors to the Condor Club might spot an unassuming historical plaque commemorating the venue's first topless and bottomless performances, a physical marker of an important milestone in topless entertainment history. The venue is widely labeled as the first topless bar in the world, opening its doors in 1958 and debuting its topless entertainment programming in 1964.
That year, Condor Club cocktail waitress Carol Doda earned notoriety as the first woman in San Francisco (and possibly the U.S.) to perform topless, resulting in an arrest for indecency and an eventual acquittal. Doda is often credited as a pioneer of the topless entertainment and sex-positive revolution, sparking a movement that would sweep San Francisco in the years following. According to many historical records, the Condor Club went on to become the country's first legal topless entertainment strip club.
Businesses that are inducted into the Legacy Business Registry receive recognition as cultural assets to the city of San Francisco and make a commitment to upholding the traditions that are distinct to their business. In addition, these businesses qualify to receive operational and marketing benefits from the city, including access to the San Francisco rent stabilization grant and stipends to put towards employment costs.
Condor Club is located at 560 Broadway in San Francisco, CA, and is open daily from 6:00PM to 2:00AM. More information about the Bay Area Striptease club can be found on its website at https://condorsf.com/ .
About Condor Club: The Condor Club has been a fixture in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood since 1964, providing prestige topless entertainment in a welcoming, fun-loving environment. Considered the world's "original Striptease club," the historic venue has hosted many of the industry's most iconic entertainers, including Carol Doda, the first-ever topless entertainer. In the decades since its opening, Condor Club has earned a reputation as one of the Bay Area's most beloved entertainment landmarks. Today, the Striptease club continues to operate as a full-service bar and topless entertainment venue, consistently rated as one of the best of its kind in the region.
For more information about Condor Club, including its storied history and upcoming events, please contact Axel Sang at 348886@email4pr.com, (415) 434-2868.

YOKNEAM ILLIT, Israel, Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- A study published in eJHaem Journal of Hematology in August 2022, compared PixCell Medical's FDA-cleared Point-of-Care 5-part differential CBC analyzer, with Sysmex's market-established Sysmex XN lab CBC analyzer.
This ground-breaking study showed HemoScreen to be more accurate in regard to leukocyte abnormalities (flagging all abnormalities). It demonstrated better specificity (88% versus Sysmex XN's 72%) as it was less prone to false flagging versus the Sysmex XN, this is owing to HemoScreen's novel machine learning-driven viscoelastic focusing technology. The study, titled "HemoScreen hematology analyzer compared to Sysmex XN for complete blood count, white blood cell differential, and detection of leukocyte abnormalities", and headed by researchers from the University of Turku, Finland, is the first ever to demonstrate a machine point-of-care CBC analyzer to be superior to the gold standard, lab-based flow cytometry analyzer.
The authors: "This study supports the previous findings of HemoScreen analyzer's good repeatability and analytical stability." states the study in the discussion section. "HemoScreen hematology analyzer is essentially comparable to Sysmex XN for CBC and WBC differential analysis. Most importantly, HemoScreen detected all the samples confirmed to include abnormal leukocytes. HemoScreen was less prone to false WBC flagging compared to Sysmex XN, thereafter requiring less microscopy review. These abilities increase its utility in small healthcare units."

- Founded in 1992, BMO's Indigenous Banking Unit serves Indigenous Peoples and communities  across Canada
- T hree organizations that focus on education and cultural reclamation will receive donations

TORONTO, Nov. 16, 2022 /CNW/ - BMO today marks the 30 th anniversary of its Indigenous Banking Unit (IBU) with contributions to Indigenous cultural and educational initiatives at three organizations.
"We're honoured to celebrate such an important milestone. Indigenous Banking is more than a business at BMO," said Mike Bonner, Head, Canadian Business Banking, and Co-Chair, BMO Indigenous Advisory Council. "Since 1992, we've built a strong presence with deep roots in hundreds of Indigenous communities across Canada and we value the tremendous trust placed in us as we make progress together toward a brighter future. Today we're marking the last thirty years, but we're even more excited about the future and the opportunity to continue to innovate to serve Indigenous customers, communities and enterprises."
BMO established its IBU 30 years ago when it made the commitment to do more to serve Indigenous communities. Since then, through a network of branches and business banking offices both on and off reserve, BMO has offered financial products and services, including housing and renovation financing, trust services, investment management solutions, and long-term financing for on-reserve infrastructure and economic development.
To mark the anniversary, BMO is donating more than $560,000 among three organizations that focus on education and cultural reclamation, including language and traditional land-based learning, the return of cultural artifacts, and the creation of safe spaces for Indigenous students.
Recipients are chosen through consultation with organizations we partner with, communities we serve and BMO's Indigenous Advisory Council, and include:
- The University of Toronto Scarborough, to build Indigenous House, which will open doorways for Indigenous learners, teachers and support workers to thrive on campus, and foster opportunities to put Indigenous inclusion into daily practice
- Newo Wellness in Saskatoon, a day camp that, through a comprehensive and decolonized approach with a focus on Indigenous Worldview, will deliver long term youth programming aimed at teaching wellness tools to influence lifelong healthy habits
- Manitou Asiniy-Iniskim-Tsa Xani, to build a learning centre designed by Douglas Cardinal to house the Manitou Stone, Canada's largest meteorite. Deeply embedded in the culture of Plains Bison Tribes, the artifact will finally be returned to the location where it first landed in the Iron Creek Alberta area

"We're honoured to support inspiring and culturally relevant initiatives that reflect BMO's commitment to advancing Truth and Reconciliation through education, employment and economic empowerment." said Clio Straram, Head, BMO Indigenous Banking Unit.

Strengthening primary care key to rebuilding Canada's crumbling healthcare system

Full text: Charlotte Webber, H+K Strategies, 613-691-2195, Charlotte.webber@hkstrategies.ca; Heidi Singer, Dalla Lana School of Public Health | University of Toronto, 416-571-7569, heidi.singer@utoronto.ca
New research from the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation at the University of Toronto reveals that strengthening primary care will relieve pressure in other areas of our healthcare system, including our overrun hospitals and healthcare workers
TORONTO, Nov. 16, 2022 /CNW/ - A new report on the sustainability and resilience of Canada's healthcare system has sounded the alarm that the current healthcare model is incapable of making the changes necessary to address the challenges faced today and will not withstand the next crisis.
The Sustainability and Resilience in the Canadian Health System report was developed by the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation (IHPME) at the University of Toronto as part of a new research initiative with the Partnership for Health System Sustainability and Resilience (PHSSR) – a global collaboration between academic, non-governmental, life sciences, healthcare and business organizations. The Canadian assessment is one of more than 20 studies, either underway or complete, in over 20 countries worldwide, including England, France and Germany.
Leveraging a framework developed by the London School of Economics and Political Science, the report identifies the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and risks of the Canadian healthcare system across seven key domains: health system governance; health system financing; health system workforce; medicines and technology; health service delivery; population health; and environmental sustainability.
According to the report, one of the areas requiring an immediate overhaul is Canada's primary care system. Reforming how we govern, fund and organize primary care, and investing in team-based primary care models, can improve access to integrated healthcare preventative, diagnostic, treatment, and palliative services. It could also significantly improve quality of care, increase efficiency, reduce wait times and lead to better patient outcomes.  
"Our healthcare system is a relic of the 1960s. The needs of Canadian patients and the healthcare professionals who care for them have evolved," said Sara Allin, lead researcher and Associate Professor, IHPME, University of Toronto. "Many Canadians cannot access primary care and waitlists for specialists are too long, meaning that many patients are much sicker when they finally access care. Our hospitals have become an overrun and expensive safety net for those who cannot get timely access to care. The current Canadian healthcare system is unsustainable."
Investing in multidisciplinary team-based primary care and enabling team members to work within their full scope of practice could take the burden off other parts of the system and improve quality of care for Canadians. Team-based care is a model of healthcare delivery where many health professionals, such as family physicians, nurses, dietitians, social workers and others work together in one setting to support the unique needs of each patient. Team-based primary care models are shown to lead to fewer hospitalizations and reduce emergency department visits for people with chronic illnesses. i  They can also help coordinate the care of their patients as they navigate the health system.
The report also calls for the immediate implementation of a Pan-Canadian Health Data Strategy, including a database of Canada's health human resources, finding that the health and social data used to inform policy decision-making are fragmented, not readily available for researchers and decision makers, and inconsistent across the country. In fact, this lack of health workforce data, strategies and projections severely limited Canada's ability to plan for the unprecedented health human resource challenges throughout the pandemic.
"Given the current healthcare crisis and the obvious need for urgent action, and given how difficult major change is, I hope that all stakeholders in our healthcare ecosystem can come together to collaborate on solutions to ensure our system is able to address the needs of today and able to withstand future shocks and stresses over the long-term," concluded Professor Allin. "As it stands right now, we will certainly not be ready for the next crisis."
In addition to existing challenges and public health emergencies, the pandemic also highlighted the vulnerability of health systems to shocks, such as weather or climate disasters, conflict and other crises. These findings underscore the importance of investing in primary care and implementing a Pan-Canadian Health Data Strategy to better position the health system for current and future crises.
Established in 2020, the PHSSR seeks to work with local academics, governments, policymakers and other stakeholders to build knowledge and guide action through research reports that offer evidence-informed policy recommendations to improve healthcare system sustainability and resilience.
About the Partnership for Health System Sustainability and Resilience
The Partnership for Health System Sustainability and Resilience (PHSSR) is a collaboration between academic, non-governmental, life sciences, healthcare and business organizations aimed at studying and helping to build health systems that are both resilient to crises and sustainable in the face of long-term stresses. The PHSSR was initiated by the London School of Economics, the World Economic Forum and AstraZeneca. In Canada, PHSSR partners include Philips Canada and the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation (IHPME) at the University of Toronto.

Full text: "E-learning: Foundations to Inclusion and Equity" provides dynamic diversity, equity and inclusion training to help workplaces unlearn oppressive behaviors and create inclusive and equitable cultures and policies
NEW YORK, Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Fearless Futures, an international diversity, equity and inclusion training and consultancy firm, announces the launch of its premier E-learning program, E-learning: Foundations to Inclusion and Equity , which educates participants on how to build inclusion and equity into their organization. Known for its transformative virtual and in-person trainings, Fearless Futures expands the accessibility of its educational offerings with this E-learning tool, enabling smaller companies, as well as corporations with teams too large to make instructor-led live training for all feasible, to advance their own anti-oppression learning in a cost-effective manner and at their own pace.
Through the program, Fearless Futures pushes e-learning to a higher level of effectiveness by keeping participants deeply invested through engaging facilitators and short chapters, while also preserving the gravity of the subject matters. Unlike typical online DEI trainings, which are mainly intended to avoid workplace litigation and therefore set a very low bar in terms of actual education, this program covers the foundational concepts of systemic oppression, intersectionality and equity. The studio-produced experience, which includes interactions, engaging animations and historical footage, is slightly over two hours and structured in 17 bitesize video chapters, interspersed with activities. Foundations to Inclusion and Equity is available globally in English with captions in different languages upon request and accessible on computers and mobile devices. 
"Making intersectional equity and inclusion education available to a large audience has always been a driving force of our organization and we are thrilled to now offer a tool that expands accessibility as well as affordability," said Hanna Naima McCloskey, founder and CEO of Fearless Futures . "We believe that everyone has a right to this education, which is key to achieving profound change. Now, from the palm of their hands or within their homes, folks can participate in the in-depth analysis required to understand intersecting oppressive systems that exist in our workplaces with our E-learning tool."
Initially developed to support schools' DEI efforts in 2014, Fearless Futures was founded by Hanna Naima McCloskey, now a seasoned facilitator and educator, to give students the tools to engage with the nuance and complexity of oppression. Following the organization's initial success, Hanna expanded Fearless Futures' teachings to cater to leaders in the corporate world in 2016, a demographic in urgent need of anti-oppression training. Since then, Fearless Futures has served employees of all levels, from c-suite leadership to junior staff working in organizations across a variety of industries including technology, finance, media and more.
To access Fearless Future's E-learning experience, visit elearning.fearlessfutures.org to experience a free demo.
Media interested in learning more about Fearless Futures and its work should contact Lisa Burkert at lisa@thetascgroup.com or 917-929-0123 .
About Fearless Futures Fearless Futures is a diversity, equity and inclusion training and consultancy firm that facilitates transformative learning experiences by actively challenging the root causes and intersections of inequities as well as their lived realities.

New integrations mean customers of all major CRMs can now take full advantage of Demandbase's capabilities, with bidirectional sync and more automated go-to-market workflows
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Demandbase , the Smarter GTM™ company for B2B brands, today announced native, bidirectional integrations with Microsoft Dynamics 365 and HubSpot CRM. This integration enables customers to use their CRM of choice to hit their revenue goals with zero waste, by identifying, engaging, and focusing their resources on accounts and prospects who are most likely to buy.
Dynamics 365 and HubSpot customers will now be able to push their CRM data into Demandbase One to inform and automate workflows, such as Lead-to-Account mapping, and tracking and taking action on engagement. Powered by a combination of the customer's data, Demandbase's proprietary data, and AI — what we call Account Intelligence — they will also be able to see and act on Demandbase intent and engagement data within their CRM. Microsoft Dynamics 365 customers, who have had access to integrated Demandbase sales intelligence, will now be able to see Demandbase engagement data along with sales intelligence in one unified view. For HubSpot customers, today's announcement expands the number of workflows they can automate beyond what is already available with Demandbase's HubSpot Marketing Automation integration. Both of these integrations improve orchestration, delivering greater sales and marketing alignment, and a friction-free experience.
"These integrations ensure our customers who use Dynamics 365 and HubSpot CRM realize the full value of the Demandbase platform," says Brewster Stanislaw, chief product officer at Demandbase. "Pairing Demandbase natively with the CRM allows our customers to orchestrate a seamless go-to-market motion with full alignment between marketing and sales. We're providing the full power of our Account Intelligence in these connected systems and saving sales and marketing teams time by providing them actionable insights wherever they want to consume them. The result is better performance with less manual effort at every stage of the customer journey."
With these integrations, customers can use their own CRM data to build lists and filters in the Demandbase One platform. They can define selectors, set up orchestration, create Demandbase campaigns, visualize and apply Demandbase intent and predictive scores, analyze journeys, and build reports. In addition, customers can write valuable Demandbase data and insights to their own Dynamics or HubSpot CRM instances. This creates unity between Demandbase and their CRM, and gives customers a single user interface in which they can view all Account Intelligence. Accurate account identification, combined with their CRM data, also means better predictive models, marketing and sales alerts, personalization opportunities, and more.

eBay Opens Store in NYC that Accepts Pre-Owned Luxury as Currency

Shoppers are invited to have their jewelry, handbags, and watches appraised and exchanged for "closet currency" to purchase authentic items from eBay's top luxury sellers
SAN JOSE, Calif., Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Open during Jewelry Week in the heart of New York's  iconic Diamond District, the eBay Luxury Exchange capitalizes on the skyrocketing value of authenticated luxury items by letting shoppers exchange jewelry, handbags and watches from top brands like Gucci, Rolex, and Van Cleef & Arpels.
"It's never been easier for luxury enthusiasts to refine their collections in a trusted environment, and we wanted to create an IRL experience that reflects what's happening on eBay every day," said Tirath Kamdar, GM of Luxury at eBay. "The Luxury Exchange gives shoppers an opportunity to appraise and sell their valuable goods, and add something new to their personal collections – just in time for the holiday season."
eBay's Luxury Exchange: How it Works

- Shoppers have their luxury items appraised and assigned a value with which they can shop the store's inventory of designer watches, handbags, and jewelry.

- Once shoppers find an item(s) within their "currency," they can make the exchange and walk out of the store with their new luxury goods.

- If nothing in the store catches a shopper's eye, guests can visit the on-site photo studio and opt to list on eBay themselves instead of exchanging.

The Luxury Exchange comes on the heels of the expansion of Authenticity Guarantee to jewelry, a move that significantly augments eBay's luxury offering. eBay launched Authenticity Guarantee in 2020, and the program now includes sneakers, watches, handbags, trading cards and now, fine jewelry. As a result, more and more shoppers are turning to eBay to buy and sell their collections. This behavior is reflected in the depth and quality of inventory available on the marketplace.
The Rise of Resale: Luxury As Currency
As economic uncertainty proliferates, interest in alternative investment classes has continued to climb. According to "The Rise of Resale: Luxury As Currency" – a new report from BoF Insights , the data and analysis think tank from The Business of Fashion , conducted in partnership with eBay – approximately 30% of U.S. luxury shoppers surveyed believe the value of luxury handbags, watches, and jewelry is less volatile than other investment assets they own 1 .
More than half of these shoppers see their luxury items as a form of currency, and they think about their collections dynamically, as a way to trade for other items that they want. What's more, sixty-two percent of respondents report that they have sold items from their collection for more than the original purchase price.
"Everyone Deserves Real" Physical authentication is the leading factor in convincing a shopper to purchase a second hand luxury handbag, watch, and jewelry on an online resale platform. eBay's commitment to authenticity in the luxury category is further evidenced by its upcoming brand campaign – "Everyone Deserves Real" – which spotlights how the pervasiveness of 'fakery' in pop culture contrasts with the very real world of eBay's authentication service and its expert authenticators.
Luxury on eBay – By the Numbers - Watches
- In 2021, eight watches were purchased on eBay in the US every minute.
- The most sold watch brands in 2022 are Hamilton, Omega, Seiko, Tag Heuer, and Tissot in the US and Canada.
- Sales for trending styles like the Omega Speedmaster and Rolex Oyster Perpetual Explorer are up triple digits YoY in the US and Canada in 2022.

- Handbags
- In 2021, a handbag was purchased on eBay in the US and Canada every 13 seconds.
- Chanel, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, and Prada are 2022's top selling handbag brands in the US and Canada.
- Sales of styles like the Balenciaga Le Cagole and Chanel 22 are up triple-digits YoY in the US and Canada in 2022.

- Jewelry
- In 2021, eBay sold eight fine jewelry items in the US and Canada every minute.
- Cartier, David Yurman, Gucci, Swarovski, and Tiffany & Co are 2022's top selling brands in the US and Canada.
- Sales of the Chanel Coco Crush Ring, David Yurman Cable Spira Bracelet, Gucci Interlocking G Bracelet, and Mikimoto Cultured Pearl Bracelet are up triple digits YoY in 2022 in the US and Canada.


eBay's Luxury Exchange – at 22 W. 47th Street, New York, NY – is open to the public from Wednesday, November 16 through Thursday, November 17, from 11am to 6pm.

DETROIT and OSLO, Norway, Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Nel Hydrogen US, a subsidiary of Nel ASA (Nel, OSE: NEL), has entered into a joint development agreement with General Motors (NYSE: GM) to help accelerate the industrialization of Nel's proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer platform. By combining GM's extensive fuel cell expertise and Nel's deep knowledge of electrolyzers, the two companies are looking to enable more cost competitive sources of renewable hydrogen.
"General Motors is one of the global leaders in hydrogen fuel cell propulsion with more than 50 years of experience. We believe this collaboration will give us a competitive advantage in industrializing the production of our PEM electrolyzers and further improving the efficiency of our technology," said Nel's CEO, Håkon Volldal.
"Adding Nel as a strategic collaborator is an important step to help us commercialize fuel cell technology. Electrolysis is key to creating consistent, clean sources of hydrogen to power fuel cells," said Charles Freese, GM executive director, Global HYDROTEC. "Nel has some of the most promising electrolyzer technology to help develop clean hydrogen infrastructure, and we believe our HYDROTEC fuel cell IP can help them get closer to scale."
Nel was the first company in the world with a fully automated alkaline electrolyzer production line. The next step will be to industrialize the production of its PEM electrolyzer equipment in a similar way which will enable considerable technology advancement.
GM is developing and commercializing both HYDROTEC hydrogen fuel cell and Ultium battery technologies that deliver where it matters most: performance and cost. This is opening new revenue potential for GM as industries – including freight trucking, aerospace, power generation and locomotive – turn to GM to improve performance and reduce emissions.
"An automated production concept is key when scaling up and driving down cost on electrolyzer technology. By utilizing the combined expertise of both companies, it will help to more quickly develop a green hydrogen technology that is competitive with fossil fuels," said Volldal.
A PEM electrolyzer and a fuel cell are largely based on the same principles. A PEM electrolyzer uses electricity and water to produce hydrogen and oxygen, while a fuel cell reverses the process, using hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity and water. As GM has made major steps and gained expertise with fuel cells, the two companies see substantial synergies by transferring this to Nel's PEM platform.
Nel will be compensating GM for the development work and IP transfer on an ongoing basis and pay a license after successful commercialization dependent on how much of the end product is based on GM technology.

Full text: Updated test with dual targets to improve coverage and sensitivity for Group B Streptococcus screening
SUNNYVALE, Calif., Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Cepheid today announced the availability of Xpert ® GBS LB XC (extended coverage), a molecular diagnostic test for qualitative detection of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) using enriched Lim broth cultures of patient samples. Xpert GBS LB XC builds upon the success of Xpert GBS LB which was launched in 2012. The next-generation test is now available and will begin shipping to US customers in November.
Accurate antepartum GBS testing is critical in the prevention of neonatal GBS infections. Xpert GBS LB XC incorporates new dual targets in highly conserved regions of the GBS genome to improve coverage and performance.
While ACOG 1 guidelines recommend universal antepartum screening for GBS to help decrease early onset neonatal sepsis, risk-based treatment leads to unnecessary antibiotics for GBS-negative females. Accurate antepartum GBS testing is critical in the prevention of neonatal GBS infections.
Xpert GBS LB XC is cleared to be used for screening of pregnant females, in line with ACOG guidance for GBS testing. The test can provide results for GBS in as soon as 27 minutes for positive results 2 . 
"In developing Xpert GBS LB XC, Cepheid added a second conserved genetic target from the  LysR  family of transcriptional regulators. The resulting target redundancy mitigates the impact of mutational drift and is a feature of many Cepheid tests."  said David Persing, M.D., Ph.D., EVP, and Chief Scientific Officer. "The newly updated test provides a rapid and accessible reference lab-quality result when it is needed most and enables better antimicrobial stewardship."

- With early assay termination for positives only; reporting of negatives in approximately 43 minutes

PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla., Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- American born and Billboard Hot 100 artist 'Yung Gravy' has been booked to perform live in Panama City Beach, FL at Harpoon Harry's on March 14, 2023. It's the first major spring break concert announcement of the year, courtesy of leading student travel company StudentEscape and marketing firm CMG Media Agency.
Early-bird tickets for this night-time headlining concert event are now on sale through the http://www.maniacvipcard.com website. Doors will open at 8pm and will feature multiple opening acts before Yung Gravy hits the stage.
Commonly referred by many as the 'Spring Break Capital of the World', Panama City Beach is a premiere destination for Spring Break events and Harpoon Harry's has been a premier concert venue, having just hosted Steve Aoki earlier this year during Spring Break 2022.
Born Matthew Raymond Hauri, but professionally known as Yung Gravy, the artist first gained recognition in 2017, when his song "Mr. Clean" gained traction on SoundCloud and is now a certified Platinum artist. Since 2017, Yung Gravy has completed seven international tours and has released one mixtape, three albums, and seven EPs. In 2022, he released his first Billboard Hot 100-charting hit, "Betty (Get Money)".
"We're extremely excited about being able to book a talented and entertaining act like Yung Gravy," said Carm Giardina, a representative of CMG Media Agency, the marketing firm responsible for all major spring break events throughout the month of March. "Giving the students what they want musically is a real thrill for us, and we know that this event is going to be nothing short of fun and entertaining for everyone in attendance."

LANCASTER, England, Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- LiNa Energy passed a key milestone after it successfully completed an independent demonstration of its lithium-free energy storage systems (made up of its sodium batteries) with commercial partner ion Ventures. The test, which challenged the energy storage system continuously for 5 days, proves it can respond to the modern demands of a national electrical grid.
The trial saw a 1kW/ 1kWh LiNa system perform Dynamic Containment, validating that it can sustain rapid injection and absorption of power to maintain the National Grid's frequency, which is a key revenue stream for battery energy storage systems in the UK.
The test was performed independently at HORIBA MIRA in Nuneaton, and was funded by the Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Energy Entrepreneurs Fund.
Rich Dawson, LiNa's CTO, said of the test "Electrical grids all around the world will need energy storage assets as renewable generation increases. This is an important demonstration for LiNa Energy, showcasing this technology's potential to meet the needs of this market."
Dan Taylor, co-founder of ion Ventures, said "This is a huge milestone for our partner LiNa Energy as the battery demonstrated its clear capability in responding to Dynamic Containment signals at the independent test centre. This continues to show the LiNa battery system will be providing a wide variety of services, as well as offering capabilities to grid operators worldwide."
Proving Dynamic Containment is a key milestone for green tech companies like LiNa as it shows that the energy storage can support operators in maintaining a narrow operating frequency which is key to the electrical grid's health, avoiding blackouts and generator trips. 
The demonstration was performed in a 1 kWh system containing LiNa's lithium and cobalt free solid state sodium battery cells. In order to ensure a robust test, a 1kW Dynamic Containment commitment was simulated against a repeating abnormally volatile frequency input. The test was performed continuously for 5 days and tested over a range of states-of-charge. The test was also run simultaneously with a charge and a discharge profile to demonstrate the critical ability to stack revenue streams. 
The demonstration was funded by BEIS's Energy Entrepreneurs Fund which supports the development of technologies, products and processes in the areas of energy efficiency, power generation, heat generation, energy storage, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and security of supply. LiNa Energy demonstrated the technology with ion Ventures, an international developer of renewable generation, clean electrification schemes and optimised, flexible power infrastructure.

Full text: Honeywell navigation and guidance technology to play a key role in each Artemis mission
PHOENIX, Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) technology is helping enable NASA's Artemis I launch, as well as several other aspects of planned NASA missions that will bring astronauts to the moon and Mars. Over the course of NASA's Artemis program, Honeywell technology will play an increasingly critical role in the Orion spacecraft and the Artemis missions.
Honeywell provides the full navigation and guidance system for the Artemis I launch vehicle. This allows the spacecraft to know exactly where it's going, stay on course and return safely to Earth. Honeywell technology is also helping control the thrust on rockets that travel 73 times faster than the cars in the Indy 500.
"We're incredibly proud that our technology is supporting the Artemis missions to bring Americans back to the moon, and eventually Mars," said Mike Madsen, president and CEO of Honeywell Aerospace. "Honeywell has been a part of every crewed space mission in NASA's history, which is a big source of pride for all of us here. Although we're proud of our legacy with previous NASA missions, I couldn't be more excited that our employees are shaping the future of human space exploration through the Artemis missions."
Honeywell will provide 14 product types for crewed Artemis missions III through V, including both hardware and software solutions, to support NASA's lunar missions. Some of those key technologies are:
- Guidance and Navigation Systems:  Key navigation and guidance solutions, including the barometric altimeter, which tracks the altitude of the Orion capsule in Earth's atmosphere, as well as the inertial measurement system and GPS receiver, which track the position and movements of the capsule.
- Command Data Handling:  Several data-handling products, including the vehicle management computer, which acts as the central computing platform supporting flight and vehicle control, as well as spacecraft communication functions.
- Displays and Controls:  Three display units and struts, seven control panels and two hand controllers used inside the spacecraft to help astronauts in the Orion capsule monitor and control the vehicle.
- Core Flight Software:  Includes the integrated modular avionics software, a key system responsible for supporting maintenance functions sharing flight data information.

Full text: PORSGRUNN, Norway, Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Reference is made to recent press release from DG Fuels regarding the execution of a long-term lease agreement with the Loring Development Authority for 1,240 acres of contiguous land in Aroostock County, Maine. This will be the site of DG Fuels' second SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) facility, and the project will break ground in the Summer of 2024.
The long-term lease agreement in Maine comes on top of DG Fuels recently securing 100% offtake from its first project in Louisiana, thus increasing the solidity of the business case. HydrogenPro has secured its position as supplier of water electrolysers to the DG Fuels projects, which will have an initial output of approximately 175 million gallons SAF per year. In total, HydrogenPro will supply green hydrogen technology with a capacity of approximately 1.7 GW to the Louisiana and Maine projects.
" The long-term lease agreement is of great strategic value and reaffirms our belief in the DG Fuels project. SAF will play a vital role in decarbonising the aviation industry, especially because it can be mixed with conventional fuel today, without the companies having to make big investments to engines or fuel tanks. We look forward to supplying the green hydrogen technology that will fuel the shift within the aviation industry, " says Richard Espeseth, interim CEO and founder of HydrogenPro.
Sustainable aviation fuel from DG Fuels is expected to remove an estimated 1.5 million tons of CO 2  out of the atmosphere annually. Compared to conventional fuel, the use of SAF can reduce emissions by an average of 80% and is considered more energy efficient. Hence, it provides airlines with operational advantages in addition to its environmental contributions.
About HydrogenPro:
HydrogenPro is a technology company and an OEM for high pressure alkaline electrolyser and supplies large scale green hydrogen plants, all ISO 9001, ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 certified. The Company was founded in 2013 by individuals with background from the electrolysis industry which was established in Telemark, Norway by Norsk Hydro in 1927. We are an experienced engineering team of leading industry experts, drawing upon unparalleled experience and expertise in the hydrogen and renewable energy industry.

Full text: DETROIT and OSLO, Norway, Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Nel Hydrogen US, a subsidiary of Nel ASA (Nel ) (OSE: NEL) , has entered into a joint development agreement with General Motors (NYSE: GM) to help accelerate the industrialization of Nel's proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser platform. By combining GM's extensive fuel cell expertise and Nel's deep knowledge of electrolysers, the two companies are looking to enable more cost competitive sources of renewable hydrogen.
"General Motors is one of the global leaders in hydrogen fuel cell propulsion with more than 50 years of experience. We believe this collaboration will give us a competitive advantage in industrializing the production of our PEM electrolysers and further improving the efficiency of our technology," said Nel's CEO, Håkon Volldal.
"Adding Nel as a strategic collaborator is an important step to help us commercialize fuel cell technology. Electrolysis is key to creating consistent, clean sources of hydrogen to power fuel cells," said Charles Freese, GM Executive Director, Global HYDROTEC. "Nel has some of the most promising electrolyser technology to help develop clean hydrogen infrastructure, and we believe our HYDROTEC fuel cell IP can help them get closer to scale."
Nel was the first company in the world with a fully automated alkaline electrolyser production line. The next step will be to industrialize the production of its PEM electrolyser equipment in a similar way which will enable considerable technology advancement.
GM is developing and commercializing both HYDROTEC hydrogen fuel cell and Ultium battery technologies that deliver where it matters most: performance and cost. This is opening new revenue potential for GM as industries – including freight trucking, aerospace, power generation and locomotive – turn to GM to improve performance and reduce emissions.
"An automated production concept is key when scaling up and driving down cost on electrolyser technology. By utilizing the combined expertise of both companies, it will help to more quickly develop a green hydrogen technology that is competitive with fossil fuels," said Volldal.
A PEM electrolyser and a fuel cell are largely based on the same principles. A PEM electrolyser uses electricity and water to produce hydrogen and oxygen, while a fuel cell reverses the process, using hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity and water. As GM has made major steps and gained expertise with fuel cells, the two companies see substantial synergies by transferring this to Nel's PEM platform.
Nel will be compensating GM for the development work and IP transfer on an ongoing basis and pay a license after successful commercialization dependent on how much of the end product is based on GM technology.

Full text: Recent release "The Rubber Band Ball Concept" from Page Publishing author Magic Liaison is a call to action for all people living on the margins of society and those who want to help.
NEW YORK, Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Magic Liaison, who advocates for the struggle and uses his pen to create the change he wants to see in today's society, has completed his new book "The Rubber Band Ball Concept": an intriguing book that explores that there are twelve rubber bands within the concept, and they are all interconnected.
Liaison writes, "are you a part of the problem or the solution? You will discover the true answer within the pages of this book. The rubber band ball concept is a book about creating change."
Published by Page Publishing, Magic Liaison's riveting work details how The Rubber Band Ball Concept identifies the problems and issues impoverished people face and unravels the complex interconnection of each problem to the next.

Liaison is from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and has been in and out of group homes, psychiatric hospitals, and detention centers his entire life. He dropped out of high school at sixteen and was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison when he was only nineteen years old. While in prison, he focused on himself and his studies. He transformed himself from a troubled adolescent into a productive grown man. He is the co-founder of the Rubber Band Ball Organization, a non-profit formed to fight poverty.

BCS DEADLINE ALERT: ROSEN, RESPECTED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Barclays PLC Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important November 22 Deadline in Securities Class Action - BCS

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --
WHY:  Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Barclays PLC (NYSE: BCS) between February 18, 2021 and March 25, 2022, both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"), of the important November 22, 2022 lead plaintiff deadline .
SO WHAT:  If you purchased Barclays securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.
WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Barclays class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=8877 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than November 22, 2022 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements or omitted material information: (1) in Barclays reported financial statements (which have been restated); (2) by stating that Barclays internal controls over financial reporting were effective (which Barclays has admitted were not effective and had a material weakness); and (3) by failing to disclose the over-issuance, and that Barclays Bank PLC ("BBPLC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Barclays, was violating U.S. securities laws and/or SEC regulations, subjecting Barclays to legal liability. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
To join the Barclays class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=8877 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.
No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Full text: HOUSTON, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport LNG) is today providing the results of an independent, third-party root cause failure analysis (RCFA) report on the June 8, 2022 incident that occurred at its liquefaction facility. The RCFA report was commissioned by Freeport LNG and independently conducted by a highly qualified incident investigation company, IFO Group, in order to identify the causes underlying the June 8 th incident. Over the course of almost five months, IFO Group investigated the incident, collected and analyzed physical specimens from the incident, interviewed witnesses, reviewed process and design data, and ultimately developed the RCFA report, identifying specific causes that led or contributed to the June 8 th incident.
The safety and security of our workforce and surrounding community, and environmental stewardship are Freeport LNG's top priorities. Freeport LNG believes that transparency around the causes of this incident, and the remedial actions it is taking to ensure an incident of this nature never occurs again, is critical to maintaining public trust.
With that in mind, the results of the root cause failure analysis prepared by IFO Group are as follows:
Direct Cause
- Isolation of a piping segment containing cryogenic liquefied natural gas (LNG) without proper overpressure protection, which LNG then warmed and expanded due to exposure to ambient conditions, resulting in a boiling liquid, expanding vapor explosion, or BLEVE, and the rupturing of the piping segment.

Root Causes  
- Pressure safety valve (PSV) testing procedure and car seal program deficiencies;
- Failure to repurpose temperature indicator alarms used for cool down operations during commissioning on LNG piping that could warn operators of increasing temperatures in LNG piping during operations; and
- Operating procedures that allowed operator discretion to close valves that could allow LNG to be isolated in a piping segment.

Contributing Causes
- Failure of 2016 Hazard and Operability study to evaluate the potential for a blocked-in LNG piping segment with inadequate overpressure protection;
- Failure to utilize management of change process for revisions to tank management operating procedures;
- Failure to accurately and timely diagnose sudden pipe movement as being due to piping stresses from the overpressuring of an adjacent piping segment; and
- Operator fatigue as a result of significant overtime needs.

IFO Group proposed recommendations to resolve each of the above root and contributing causes, and Freeport LNG is implementing each of those recommendations. Specifically, Freeport LNG has made significant enhancements to its PSV testing processes and car seal program, implemented procedural changes to avoid operating scenarios that could allow blocked-in LNG in piping segments, and revised its control system logic to alert control room operators to valve positions or temperature readings that indicate possible isolation of LNG in any piping segments. Freeport LNG is also updating its training program to address causes of the incident, as well as identification and diagnosis of abnormal operating conditions in the facility. 
To supplement IFO's report, Freeport LNG also engaged another independent consultant to perform a full review of its LNG storage and transfer operating procedures, its control systems maintenance and inspection procedures, and its personnel qualifications and training programs. As a result of this independent, multi-month review, Freeport LNG is implementing various recommended improvements in these areas. Additionally, Freeport LNG has undertaken a significant hiring effort to increase LNG plant employee staffing by over 30%, in order to reduce the amount of overtime, as well as create new functional departments within the organization that are focused on improved training, operational excellence, quality assurance, and improved business performance. Freeport LNG is also executing an extensive company-wide process safety management initiative to apply and reinforce process safety concepts into daily work processes across the organization.
Freeport LNG is committed to emerging from the June 8 th incident with an unmatched focus on safety, operational integrity and operational excellence. 
ABOUT FREEPORT LNG Freeport LNG is an LNG export company headquartered in Houston, Texas. The company's three train, 15 MTPA liquefaction facility is the seventh largest in the world and second largest in the U.S. Freeport LNG's liquefaction facility is the largest all-electric drive motor plant of its kind in the world, making it the most environmentally sustainable site of its kind. The facility's electric drive motors reduce carbon emissions by over 90% relative to gas turbine-driven liquefaction facilities. Freeport plans to expand by adding a fourth liquefaction train, which has received all regulatory approvals for construction. Freeport was formed in 2002 to develop, own and operate an LNG terminal on Quintana Island, near Freeport, Texas. The terminal started LNG import operations in June 2008 and began LNG export operations in 2019. Further information can be found on Freeport's website at www.freeportlng.com .

Full text: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- CIBanco, S.A., Institución de Banca Múltiple, solely in its capacity as trustee of trust CIB/3332, also known as Fibra SOMA (the "Company" or "we" or "us") announced today that it commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash an aggregate principal amount of the 4.375% Senior Notes due 2031 (CUSIP Nos. 171653AA6/ P26064AA6; ISIN Nos. US171653AA64/ USP26064AA66) (the "Notes") issued by the Company (the "Offer") for an aggregate purchase price, excluding accrued and unpaid interest, if any, of up to U.S.$150 million (the "Tender Cap"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the offer to purchase dated November 15, 2022 (the "Offer to Purchase"). We refer to the aggregate amount that Holders are entitled to receive for Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and accepted for purchase in the Offer, excluding Accrued Interest (as defined below), as the "Aggregate Purchase Price."
Consideration
Holders who validly tender their Notes on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on November 29, 2022 (the "Early Tender Date") and do not validly withdraw their Notes on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on November 29, 2022 (the "Withdrawal Date") will be eligible to receive the "Total Consideration" of U.S.$710.00 per U.S.$1,000 per principal amount of Notes tendered. The Total Consideration includes an "Early Tender Premium" of U.S.$50.00 per U.S.$1,000 principal amount of Notes. Holders who validly tender their Notes after the Early Tender Date but on or prior to 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on December 13, 2022 (the "Expiration Date") will be eligible to receive the "Tender Consideration" of U.S.$660.00 per U.S.$1,000 per principal amount of Notes tendered, which is equal to the Total Consideration less the Early Tender Premium.
Holders whose Notes are accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offer will also be paid accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes ("Accrued Interest") up to, but excluding, the applicable Settlement Date (as defined below), together with additional amounts thereon, if any.

The amount to be paid for each U.S.$1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offer to Purchase, excluding Accrued Interest on the Notes to the applicable Settlement Date. Holders whose Notes are accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offer to Purchase will also receive Accrued Interest up to, but excluding, the applicable Settlement Date, together with additional amounts thereon, if any.

(2)
The Total Consideration equals the Tender Consideration plus the Early Tender Premium.

(3)
If the purchase of all Notes validly tendered on or prior to the Early Tender Date would cause us to purchase an aggregate principal amount of Notes for an Aggregate Purchase Price that would exceed the Tender Cap, then the Offer will be oversubscribed at the Early Tender Date.  Accordingly, we will not accept for purchase any Notes after the Early Tender Date and we will (assuming satisfaction or, where applicable, the waiver of the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, including the New Debt Condition) accept for purchase on the Early Acceptance Date (or the Expiration Date, if the Early Settlement Right is not exercised), the Notes tendered on or prior to the Early Tender Date on a prorated basis such that we purchase Notes for an Aggregate Purchase Price that would not exceed the Tender Cap in the Offer. If the purchase of all Notes validly tendered in the Offer after the Early Tender Date and on or prior to the Expiration Date would cause us to purchase an aggregate principal amount of Notes for an Aggregate Purchase Price that would exceed the Tender Cap, then we will (assuming satisfaction or, where applicable, the waiver of the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase) accept for purchase such tendered Notes on a prorated basis such that we purchase Notes for an Aggregate Purchase Price that would not exceed the Tender Cap in the Offer. All Notes not accepted as a result of proration will be rejected from the Offer and promptly returned to the tendering Holder. Notes may be tendered and accepted for payment only in principal amounts equal to US$200,000 and integral multiples of US$1,000 in excess thereof.  No alternative, conditional or contingent tenders will be accepted. To ensure we return Notes in minimum principal amounts of US$200,000 and integral multiples of US$1,000 in excess thereof, if necessary, we will make appropriate adjustments downward to the nearest US$1,000 principal amount, or if applicable, the minimum denomination of US$200,000, with respect to each Holder validly tendering Notes.  Any tender of Notes, the proration of which would otherwise result in a return of any such Notes to a tendering Holder in a principal amount below the minimum denomination of US$200,000, may be rejected in full or accepted in full in our sole discretion. Holders who tender less than all their Notes must continue to hold Notes in the applicable Authorized Denominations (as defined below).

Conditions
The Offer is not conditioned on any minimum amount of Notes being tendered or the consummation of any other offer. However, consummation of the Offer is conditioned upon satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, including, without limitation, that the New Debt Transaction (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) has been successfully consummated, and that the credit agreement among us and the lenders party thereto in the New Debt Transaction shall be in effect (the "New Debt Condition"). We reserve the right to terminate or extend the Offer if any condition of the Offer is not satisfied (or we determine in our sole discretion that it is not reasonably likely that any such condition will be satisfied) or waived by us, including without limitation the New Debt Condition, and otherwise to amend the Offer in any respect. If we amend a condition to the Offer, we will give the appropriate holders such notice of the amendment and make a public announcement thereof as may be required by applicable law.
Settlement
Following the Early Tender Date and prior to the Expiration Date, we may, but are not required to, accept the Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date (the "Early Settlement Right"), provided that all conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, including without limitation the New Debt Condition, have been satisfied or waived by us (the date of such acceptance, the "Early Acceptance Date"). Notes accepted on an Early Acceptance Date will be settled promptly thereafter (the "Early Settlement Date"). The "Final Settlement Date" is the date that we settle all Notes not previously settled on the Early Settlement Date, if any, and we expect such date to be promptly following the Expiration Date (any references to "Settlement Date," refer to each of the Early Settlement Date and the Final Settlement Date as context may require).
Subject to applicable law, the Offer may be amended, extended or terminated in our sole discretion. If we determine, in our sole discretion, to extend the Offer beyond the Expiration Date, there will be a new Settlement Date with respect to Notes validly tendered on or prior to the Expiration Date. During any extension of the Offer, all Notes previously tendered and not accepted for purchase pursuant to such Offer will remain subject to such Offer and may, subject to the terms and conditions of such Offer, be accepted for purchase by us. No extension of either the Early Tender Date or the Expiration Date will require the extension of withdrawal rights, unless required by applicable law. We expressly reserve our right, but we are not required, to increase the Tender Cap in our sole discretion, without extending the Withdrawal Date, the Early Tender Date, the Expiration Date or any Settlement Date or otherwise reinstating withdrawal rights, except as may be required by applicable law.
Acceptance and Proration
We are offering to purchase for cash an aggregate principal amount of its outstanding Notes up to an Aggregate Purchase Price not to exceed the Tender Cap, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in, and for the consideration described in the Offer to Purchase.
If the purchase of all Notes validly tendered on or prior to the Early Tender Date would cause us to purchase an aggregate principal amount of Notes for an Aggregate Purchase Price that would exceed the Tender Cap, then the Offer will be oversubscribed at the Early Tender Date.  Accordingly, we will not accept for purchase any Notes after the Early Tender Date and we will (assuming satisfaction or, where applicable, the waiver of the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, including the New Debt Condition) accept for purchase on the Early Acceptance Date (or the Expiration Date, if the Early Settlement Right is not exercised), the Notes tendered on or prior to the Early Tender Date on a prorated basis such that we purchase Notes for an Aggregate Purchase Price that would not exceed the Tender Cap in the Offer.
If the purchase of all Notes validly tendered in the Offer after the Early Tender Date and on or prior to the Expiration Date would cause us to purchase an aggregate principal amount of Notes for an Aggregate Purchase Price that would exceed the Tender Cap, then we will (assuming satisfaction or, where applicable, the waiver of the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase) accept for purchase such tendered Notes on a prorated basis such that we purchase Notes for an Aggregate Purchase Price that would not exceed the Tender Cap in the Offer.
In the event of any such proration, we will only accept tenders of Notes subject to proration to the extent such proration will not result in (i) us accepting Notes from any Holder in an aggregate principal amount of less than US$200,000 or (ii) the aggregate principal amount of Notes not purchased nor held by any holder equaling less than US$200,000. In the event proration is required with respect to the Notes, we will round downward, if necessary, to ensure all purchases of Notes will be in a principal amount of US$200,000 and integral multiples of US$1,000 in excess thereof (the "Authorized Denomination"). Depending on the amount tendered and the proration factor applied, if the principal amount of Notes that otherwise would be returned to a Holder as a result of proration would result in less than the minimum Authorized Denomination mentioned above being returned to such Holder, we will, in our sole discretion, either accept or reject all of such Holder's validly tendered Notes.
All Notes not accepted as a result of proration will be rejected from the Offer and promptly returned to the tendering Holder.

Full text: SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Miosotis Garcia Maldonado, MD, MS, is being recognized by Continental Who's Who as an Exceptional Woman in Healthcare in the Medical field and in acknowledgment of her work as a Pathologist at HRP Labs.
A top professional in the field of pathology, Dr. Maldonado is Director of the Department of Cytology at HRP Labs, having joined the faculty in 2010. She is also Head of the Research and Development Division at the Academy of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine in Puerto Rico and is a part of the Fine Needle Aspiration medical faculty.
From 2006 until 2007, the doctor worked as an assistant pathologist at Domenech Pathology and Associates, and in 2008 went on to work as an Assistant Professor and Attending Pathologist at the Ponce School of Medicine's Department of Pathology. She was also an evaluator of cases of anatomical and clinical pathology in Southern Pathology Services.
In pursuit of a medical career, Dr. Maldonado studied medicine at the Central University of the Caribbean's School of Medicine, where she also completed her residency in pathology. She earned a Master's degree in Science from the University of Puerto Rico.
Passionate about her profession, the doctor is board-certified in anatomic and clinical pathology by the American Board of Pathology (ABPath). The mission of the ABPath is to promote the health of the public and advance the practice and science of pathology by establishing voluntary certification standards and assessing the qualifications of those seeking to practice the specialty of pathology.
Pathology is a branch of medical science that involves the study and diagnosis of disease by examining surgically removed organs, tissues, bodily fluids, and in some cases, the whole body. Pathologists are physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and management of diseases by laboratory methods.
Dr. Maldonado hopes to inspire others to go into the pathology field. She is very collaborative and enjoys sharing her knowledge. She hopes to continue to grow and learn new things every day.
In her spare time, the doctor loves traveling, hiking, and reading. She also used to train dogs, but she has not found the time for that in recent years.

HOUSTON, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Sempra Infrastructure, a subsidiary of Sempra (NYSE: SRE) (BMV: SRE), today announced it has entered into a heads of agreement (HOA) with Williams (NYSE: WMB) for the offtake of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and development of associated natural gas pipeline projects to further connect abundant U.S. natural gas supplies in the Gulf Coast region to markets around the world.
The HOA contemplates negotiation and finalization of two 20-year long-term sale and purchase agreements for approximately 3 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of LNG in the aggregate from the Port Arthur LNG project under development in Jefferson County, Texas, and the Cameron LNG Phase 2 project under development in Hackberry, Louisiana. The HOA also contemplates the negotiation of a separate natural gas sales agreement for approximately 0.5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcfd) to be delivered in the Gillis, Louisiana area, as feed gas supply for the referenced LNG projects.
In addition, Sempra Infrastructure and Williams anticipate forming a strategic joint venture to own, expand and operate the existing 2.35 Bcfd Cameron Interstate Pipeline that is expected to deliver natural gas to the Cameron LNG Phase 2 project under development, as well as the proposed Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector that is expected to deliver natural gas to the proposed Port Arthur LNG facility.
"We are excited to continue advancing our U.S. Gulf Coast LNG and associated pipeline projects as we work to help satisfy a growing global demand for cleaner, more reliable energy sources," said Justin Bird, CEO of Sempra Infrastructure. "We look forward to advancing our relationship with Williams, a like-minded company that shares our commitment to building a future of energy abundance, affordability and security."
"Williams is pleased to pursue this strategic transaction with Sempra Infrastructure. We see it as an opportunity to combine our capabilities along the natural gas value chain and increase the delivery of low-carbon, affordable and reliable natural gas from the wellhead to the growing international market," said Alan Armstrong, president and CEO of Williams. "Facilitating the delivery of next generation natural gas to ease energy constraints at home and overseas, while also helping to meet domestic and global climate goals, is central to our natural gas focused strategy, and we look forward to being well aligned with Sempra Infrastructure's unique capabilities and competitive advantages in the LNG infrastructure space."
Port Arthur LNG has the potential to become one of the largest LNG export facilities in North America. Phase 1 of Port Arthur LNG is permitted and expected to include two liquefaction trains and LNG storage tanks, as well as associated facilities capable of producing, under optimal conditions, up to approximately 13.5 Mtpa of LNG. Sempra Infrastructure recently announced it is expecting to take a final investment decision for Phase 1 of the liquefaction project in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, the company announced last month that it had amended and restated its engineering, procurement and construction contract with Bechtel Energy for Phase 1. Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 is being developed as a similarly sized project located adjacent to the Phase 1 project.
The Cameron LNG Phase 2 project is expected to include a single LNG train with a maximum production capacity of 6.75 Mtpa of LNG, as well as debottlenecking of the existing three LNG trains. The project is expected to include certain design enhancements resulting in a more cost-effective and efficient facility, while also reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions.
The referenced HOA is a preliminary, non-binding arrangement, and the development of Sempra Infrastructure's LNG and associated pipeline projects remains subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including reaching definitive agreements, securing all necessary permits, signing engineering and construction contracts where applicable, obtaining financing and reaching a final investment decision for each project.

PLOVER, Wis., Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- The Women In Trucking Association (WIT) presented Trina Norman, Southern California Feeder Operations Manager, UPS, with the 2022 Influential Woman in Trucking award.

Full text: Design Engineers can now view USB4 80Gbps Simulation Output in the
Industry's Leading Protocol Analyzer Software
SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- USB Developer Days 2022 -- Teledyne LeCroy Inc., the worldwide leader in protocol test solutions, today announced the release of Simulation Protocol Analyzer Software System for USB (SimPASS USB), supporting the newly released USB4 80Gbps specification, to address the pre-silicon simulation and design verification phases of development. SimPASS USB brings the powerful Teledyne LeCroy data traffic analysis capabilities to the simulation environment. Users of cutting-edge simulation tools can generate SimPASS compatible export files and view these test vectors directly in the Teledyne LeCroy trace viewer. 
USB4 I/O traffic Register Transfer Level (RTL) simulation vector files can now be displayed and analyzed in the same way as hardware-derived trace files are analyzed in the post-silicon phase by using the powerful protocol behavior analysis, visualization and "drill down" capabilities of the USB Protocol Suite software. Major issues facing USB4 developers, such as flaws in power state transitions, improper credit flow exchanges and marginal timing handshakes can be discovered, tracked to their source, and resolved. Issues identified and fixed in simulation can be verified by regenerating the simulation and analysis in the SimPASS USB software. Doing this before committing the design to silicon is a major advance in eliminating design flaws that can cause expensive and time-consuming redesign work. 
"The ability to track down errors using the familiar Teledyne LeCroy USB Protocol Suite displays and error reports makes the verification and regression process easier for the engineers involved," said Joe Mendolia, vice-president of marketing at Teledyne LeCroy. "SimPASS USB can import unlimited simulation files and provide the added benefit of allowing developers to use the same protocol analysis tool set when moving to real devices for post-silicon testing and debug, resulting in faster time-to-market and lower development costs for System-on-a-Chip (SoC) designs."
Availability The SimPASS USB software tool supports the recently released USB4 80Gbps specification. For more information, please contact your regional Sales Engineer: 1-800-909-7211 or 408-653-1262; or email protocolsales@teledynelecroy.com. Learn more at: https://teledynelecroy.

Full text: 'We Don't Serve Teens' Education Campaign Launches Nov. 15
ATCHISON, Kan., Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Distilling solutions and branded spirits leader MGP Ingredients, Inc., (Nasdaq: MGPI), is lending support to an industry-wide campaign aimed at preventing underage drinking in the United States. 'We Don't Serve Teens' reminds communities – from parents to on- and off-premise retailers– that everyone plays a role in keeping alcohol out of the hands of young people.
'We Don't Serve Teens' utilizes social media, point-of-sale materials and an online presence to educate and provide strategies to discourage selling, serving or supplying underage drinkers.
MGP's branded spirits division will share the campaign across its family of premium spirits including Yellowstone Select Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey; El Mayor Tequila; and Remus Straight Bourbon Whiskey, and everyday favorites like Everclear and Salvador's. Lux Row Distillers and Limestone Branch Distillery also will promote the campaign, as will the Luxco LinkedIn page.
The distilling solutions division will join the campaign via its MGP Distillery Collective Facebook page, an industry-focused platform that encourages discussion about all aspects of distilling. MGP also will participate via its LinkedIn page.
"While teen drinking has declined to historically low levels over the past 25 years, the partners in the 'We Don't Serve Teens' initiative want to keep those numbers moving in the right direction," said CEO and President Dave Colo.
A recent survey indicates there is more work to do in this regard. According to the December 2021 Monitoring the Future Survey, 77% of high school seniors reported that alcohol was easy to get, if they wanted some. Additional research provided by 'We Don't Serve Teens' found that 85% of respondents "do not think that teens buy alcohol themselves."
"MGP is proud to be a part of 'We Don't Serve Teens' initiative," Colo said. "This timely education and awareness effort continues our longstanding commitment to be a good corporate citizen and a good neighbor."

CMG President and Editor-in-Chief, Shen Haixiong, said at the launch ceremony in Beijing on Monday that the feature film "will help people in Indonesia, Thailand and other countries gain a deeper understanding of China's past present and future." They show "a credible China, a lovely China and a China worthy of respect," he said.
Addressing the ceremony by videolink, Lestari Moerdijat, deputy speaker of the People's Consultative Assembly of Indonesia, praised the collaboration. She said, "Classics Quoted by Xi Jinping" was the product of "fruitful cooperation." Co-produced by CMG and Televisi Republik Indonesia (TVRI), Moerdijat said the film would "enhance mutual understanding," and contribute to "cultural communication between Indonesia and China."
The former deputy prime minister of Thailand, Phinij Jarusombat, agreed. Jarusombat, who is also president of the Thai-Chinese Cultural Relationship Council, said the film would strengthen "people-to-people exchanges between Thailand and China." He encouraged more cooperation between CMG and the Thai media to curb "prejudice and misunderstanding."
Shen Haixiong announced the online launch of "Classics Quoted by Xi Jinping" with Vice President of TVRI, Andi Asrul Sani Fauzan, and Management Executive of Nation Group (Thailand) Public Company Limited, Adisak Limparungpattanakij, Shen also announced the online launch of "China on a New Journey" with media representatives of major television stations from Thailand, Cambodia, India, Laos, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Türkiye.

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP ("GPM") announces that investors with substantial losses have opportunity to lead the securities fraud class action lawsuit against U.S. Bancorp ("U.S. Bancorp" or the "Company") (NYSE: USB).

Full text: Season-long competition rewards players who make better decisions on the most strategically challenging holes across the PGA TOUR and LPGA Tour
PGA TOUR winner Scottie Scheffler claimed equal $1 million prize in August
NAPLES, Fla., Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Aon plc (NYSE: AON), a leading global professional services firm, and the LPGA Tour today announced that Minjee Lee has won the 2022 Aon Risk Reward Challenge and the $1 million prize, thanks to her performance using information and advice to make better decisions on the most strategically challenging holes throughout the season-long competition on the LPGA Tour.
"We are excited to congratulate Minjee on joining Scottie Scheffler as this year's Aon Risk Reward Challenge Champion. Her approach to the game and ability to execute in the moments that matter most is so impressive," said Jennifer Bell, Chief Executive Officer, North America at Aon. "This season really came down to the wire, but we are thrilled to award Minjee with the Aon trophy and $1 million prize." 
Lee has been one of the stars of the LPGA Tour season, winning twice, including the U.S. Women's Open presented by ProMedica, and currently sits in third place in the Race to the CME Globe. Lee's strong performance off the tee gave her the clarity and confidence she needed to make better decisions on the Aon Risk Reward Challenge holes, allowing her to go for the green 58 percent of the time versus the LPGA Tour average of 32 percent. Her approach shots on Challenge holes averaged 16 feet closer than the Tour average and she finished the Challenge second in strokes gained overall, which helped her to clinch this year's title.
"It's inspiring to see a company like Aon show up for women's golf in such a big way, and the equal prize money really showcases their dedication to gender equity, both on and off the golf course." said Lee. "I've had a great season this year, and winning the Aon Risk Reward Challenge is just the cherry on top."
Lee joins Hannah Green and Carlota Ciganda on the list of Aon Risk Reward Challenge Champions on the LPGA Tour. To view the final Aon Risk Reward Challenge leaderboard on the LPGA Tour and for more information, click here.
"Aon's partnership with the LPGA has been game-changing for our players but also is a statement about the company's commitment to women and to equity in sports," said LPGA Tour Commissioner Mollie Marcoux Samaan. "Through this investment in the LPGA, Aon is displaying a firm belief in our players and has provided us with another exciting way to showcase their world-class talent each week throughout the season. Congratulations to Minjee Lee on winning this year's Challenge and thank you Aon for your continued support. I already can't wait for next year's edition of the Aon Risk Reward Challenge as this initiative continues to evolve and grow."

- In October 2022, AbbVie announced that the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor upadacitinib (Rinvoq) had been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adults with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) who have objective signs of inflammation and have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.
- In October 2022, Incyte announced that data from the pivotal Phase III TRuE-V clinical trial program evaluating ruxolitinib cream (OpzeluraTM) 1.5% in patients 12 years of age and older with nonsegmental vitiligo had been published in "The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)."
- In September 2022, -Bristol Myers Squibb announced new two-year results from the POETYK PSO long-term extension (LTE) trial demonstrating clinical efficacy was maintained with continuous Sotyktu™ (deucravacitinib) treatment in adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. This analysis assessed patients from the pivotal POETYK PSO-1 trial who transitioned into the LTE trial. At 112 weeks of Sotyktu treatment, modified non-responder imputation (mNRI) response rates were 82.4% for Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75, 55.2% for PASI 90 and 66.5% for static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) 0/1.

JAK Inhibitors Overview
Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are small molecules of about 400 Da that can be administered orally. JAKs are phosphotransferases that bind to cytokine receptor intracellular domains and transmit signals to activate immune responses. Many interleukins, interferons, colony-stimulating factors, and hormone-like cytokines are among the cytokines that signal via JAKs (such as erythropoietin). These cytokine receptors communicate via various combinations of four JAKs (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2).
Tofacitinib and baricitinib (and oclacitinib in dogs) are first-generation jakinibs that block more than one JAK and thus inhibit many cytokines; these and other pan-jakinibs are being studied as therapeutic agents for a wide range of autoimmune diseases.
Several JAK inhibitor clinical trials are currently underway, ranging from cancer to autoimmune diseases like psoriasis. Several other JAK inhibitors may be effective in the treatment of multiple disorders in the future.

JAK Inhibitors Pipeline Analysis: Drug Profile
RINVOQ: AbbVie
RINVOQ, a selective JAK inhibitor discovered and developed by AbbVie scientists, is being studied in a variety of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. RINVOQ inhibited JAK-1 more effectively than JAK-2, JAK-3, and TYK-2 in enzymatic and cellular assays. The importance of inhibiting specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic efficacy and safety is unknown at this time.
RINVOQ is currently being studied in phase III trials for colitis, giant cell arteritis, and Takayasu arteritis.
Filgotinib: Galapagos
Galapagos' Filgotinib (200 mg and 100 mg tablets) is approved and marketed in Europe and Japan for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA who have not responded adequately or are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Filgotinib can be used alone or in conjunction with methotrexate (MTX). Filgotinib was submitted to the European Commission for an expanded indication for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis who had an inadequate response, lost response to, or were intolerant to, conventional therapy or a biologic agent.

TAIPEI, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Infortrend® Technology, Inc. (TWSE: 2495), the industry-leading enterprise storage provider, has released their new EonStor GS 3024UT and 4024U all-flash unified storage solutions featuring 100GbE RDMA, and PCIe Gen4 that can maximize high-performance computing (HPC) efficiency while reducing total cost of ownership.
With HPC making its way into small to medium enterprises, it has been generating complex data and placing higher demands for data storage solutions. With a common industry write speed of 7GB/s, some customers are now demanding 12GB/s. An HPC's mixture of random and sequential data I/O requires the storage solution to facilitate high IOPS and throughput to cope with its parallel file system workloads. In addition, the remote direct memory access (RDMA) technology has become a prerequisite for some of the HPC file systems (StorNext, GPFS, BeeGFS, Lustre, etc.), allowing for more free hardware resources.
Design to meet the demand of HPC storage needs, Infortrend's EonStor GS U.2 all-flash models (GS 3024UT and GS 4024U) deliver up to 1.1M IOPS and support 100GbE with RDMA technology to offer up to 24GB/s read and 12GB/s write throughput. 
To coincide with modern server infrastructures on 100GbE protocol, GS U.2 100GbE all-flash series offers performances that can effectively minimize client/ server I/O performance discrepancies in sophisticated HPC applications. The systems provide similar performance to four 32G Fibre channels with a single 100GbE. With the need to purchase less hardware and consume less power, it also reduces the cost of ownership.
"Designed to help maximize HPC efficiency, GS U.2 all-flash 100GbE solutions are cost-effect, support highly complex and data-intensive workloads generated by HPC applications with low latency and high throughput bandwidths," said Frank Lee, Senior Director of Product Planning at Infortrend.

Full text: - Tuned was announced as the winner of the UCSF Health Hub Digital Health Rising Star award in the Employer Prevention & Wellness Category
- A quarter of working-age adults experience hearing issues, including ringing in the ears (tinnitus), balance issues, and auditory processing disorders, underscoring the need for comprehensive hearing healthcare in the workplace
- Tuned's telehealth platform provides comprehensive hearing health as a benefit within employer-sponsored plans, alongside medical, dental, vision, and mental healthcare

NEW YORK, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Tuned , a hearing health company focused on providing hearing care for all, won the 4th Annual UCSF Health Hub Digital Health Rising Star Award in the Employer Prevention & Wellness category. Announced yesterday at HLTH 2022, the award acknowledges the employer-targeted digital health products or solutions that help improve overall employee health & wellness through better prevention program management. The win underscores the innovative approach that Tuned is taking to improve hearing care accessibility for those who need it.
Tuned expands the current employer-sponsored benefit landscape by offering hearing care as a specialty benefit, making it as accessible as medical, dental, vision, and mental healthcare. Employers that use Tuned take a preventative, holistic approach to hearing care complete with transparent pricing models and enrollment support.
Nearly 25% of working-age adults experience hearing issues, from ringing in the ears (tinnitus) to balance issues and auditory processing disorders. Undiagnosed hearing loss can have a harmful impact on quality of life , including increased anxiety, depression, social isolation, and reduced mental health and cognitive function. Because workers rely on their sense of hearing more than ever due to high levels of headphone usage and an increased amount of time on video conference calls in the remote work environment, addressing these symptoms is more relevant today than ever.
Tuned's platform boasts more than 180 Doctors of Audiology who provide unbiased online consultations that help consumers understand the severity of their hearing loss and what steps can be made to mitigate any issues. These audiologists provide recommendations that include fixes like earplugs, specialty apps to be used in conjunction with earbuds, and hearing aids or surgery for those with moderate to severe hearing loss.
"Receiving the UCSF Rising Star award is an amazing achievement for Tuned that serves to highlight the strength of our mission to provide comprehensive hearing care for everyone who needs it," said Kate McGinley , Chief Growth Officer and co-founder, Tuned. "Tuned is  dedicated to bringing hearing care to those with mild to moderate hearing issues, a population that until now has been largely ignored."
Tuned was also recently named one of the winners of the Employer Health Innovation Roundtable (EHIR) Pitch Competition, and was recognized by the Hearing Technology Innovator Awards™ for outstanding telehealth service delivery.
The UCSF Health Hub Digital Health Awards recognize the achievements of innovative health tech companies that are dramatically improving healthcare through the use of technology in the digital health industry. The Rising Star track is new this year, recognizing up-and-coming companies to watch in the digital health space.
Winners were announced on November 14th at HLTH 2022 in Las Vegas, the preeminent event in the healthcare industry.

Full text: Care orchestration pioneer lauded for its innovative work transforming the way hospitals and health systems tackle care coordination
BOSTON and LAS VEGAS, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Lumeon, the leading care orchestration solution provider, today announced that it has been recognized as a Rising Star in the New EHR Innovations category of the 4th Annual UCSF Health Hub Digital Health Awards. The award recognizes the achievements of innovative health tech companies that are dramatically improving healthcare using technology. Winners were announced during the grand finale gala on November 14 at HLTH 2022 in Las Vegas.
Lumeon won for its work in revolutionizing care orchestration. Its approach differs from existing antiquated methods of care coordination, which are overly manual, expensive, and nearly impossible to scale. Lumeon's automated care orchestration platform analyzes real-time data and applies clinical intelligence to automatically orchestrate care based on the individual needs of every patient. This approach empowers health systems to effectively scale and deliver consistent care with less manual intervention. Specifically, it automates all phases of care coordination; reduces busywork; automates outreach to patients to glean information, eliminating phone tag; adjusts pathways; and turbocharges EHRs not equipped to automate care coordination tasks. 
"With the ongoing healthcare worker shortage and the increasing incidence of clinician burnout, the healthcare industry today is challenged more than ever before with finding new ways to improve care quality while ensuring efficiency," said Greg Miller, chief growth officer of Lumeon . "Being recognized as a leading innovator with this UCSF Health Hub Digital Health Award is an incredible validation of the pioneering work being done by the entire Lumeon team." 
Since 2019, UCSF Health Hub, a digital health accelerator working with digital health startups from around the world, has hosted the Digital Health Awards to identify the most innovative upcoming digital health companies in the biggest areas of digital health, including Telemedicine and Application of AI.
About UCSF Health Hub Digital Health Awards

Past winners include: AmWell (Application in Telehealth, 2021), Cityblock (Mental and Behavioral Health, 2021), Conversa (Remote Diagnostics, 2020), Eko (Hospital Diagnostics, 2020), Oura (Consumer Wellness, 2020), Dr. On Demand (Telemedicine, 2019), Livongo (Application of AI, 2019). 2021 winners can be viewed here, 2020 here and 2019 here. Previous year's award shows have been viewed thousands of times. The 2021 Grand Finale Video can be viewed here.
About Lumeon  
Lumeon believes that care better coordinated is care better delivered. Lumeon is a digital health company that provides a cloud-based care orchestration platform that automates the tasks, workflow, activities, and events that occur during the process of coordinating care. With real-time, bi-directional data/system integration and the dynamic application of clinical intelligence and automation, Lumeon ensures that each patient receives the right care at the right time – every time.

BOSTON, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Coast Dental announced today it's partnered with Overjet, the industry leader in dental artificial intelligence, to add AI-powered radiograph analysis and clinical insights to enhance patient care.
The FDA-cleared AI technology adds color and quantification to X-rays to detect and outline decay, measure bone levels, and draw the eye to areas that require a closer look. It's a powerful tool for dentists as they diagnose, and a compelling visual aid for patients.
"Overjet's AI helps create clinical consistency, and increases trust between the providers and patients," said Derek Diasti, the CEO of Coast Dental, a dental support organization with more than 110 practices in Florida, Georgia, and Texas.

Overjet analyzes the patient database to provide clinical and operational insights that dentists can use to plan their day, improve efficiency, enhance patient care, and increase insurance claim approvals.
"Coast Dental's mission is to provide quality care and we are proud to partner with them to achieve that goal," said Dr. Teresa Dolan, the Chief Dental Officer at Overjet. "We are committed to improving oral health by creating a future that is clinically-precise, efficient, and patient-centric."

Two thirds agree that understanding cash flow in real time will be crucial - but just 2% of those surveyed by BlackLine are completely confident in the visibility they currently have
LOS ANGELES and LONDON and SINGAPORE and SYDNEY, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- A global survey of C-suite executives and finance and accounting (F&A) professionals commissioned by BlackLine, Inc. (Nasdaq: BL) has revealed a significant lack of confidence among the C-suite and F&A professionals when it comes to the visibility their company has over its cash flow, suggesting that many global organizations could be making decisions without an accurate, up-to-date view of company liquidity. This comes despite findings that suggest that visibility over cash flow and other financial metrics could be the key to businesses weathering the growing global economic storm.
The survey of 1,483 business leaders and F&A professionals (conducted by independent research agency Censuswide across the US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Singapore and Australia) also found that organizations globally are anticipating growing pressure and scrutiny over company financials as a result of ongoing economic uncertainty, with the highest number of C-suite respondents indicating it will take between seven months and a year before they start to feel confident about the economy again. As a result, optimizing working capital and accounts receivable processes is high on the agenda, as companies look to bolster their financial resiliency to combat market instability.
Keeping Track of Cash With recessionary fears on the rise, four in 10 (43%) of those surveyed are concerned that rising interest rates will result in more of their customers paying late (rising to 55% among CEOs). A similar percentage (42%) are worried that prospects or customers will have less income to spend, which could impact sales/revenue, and 41% are worried that their organization will face higher costs.
Perhaps as a result, 62% agree that understanding cash flow in real time is going to become more important for their company in the face of economic uncertainty. But nearly all respondents (98%) said they could be more confident in the visibility they currently have over cash flow.
This suggests that the majority of global organizations could be at a serious disadvantage when it comes to making strategic decisions. Of those that believe visibility could be improved, 49% are worried their company is making decisions based on inaccurate or out-of-date information and 44% say the lack of visibility over cash flow makes them less confident that their organization can remain competitive over the next 12 months.
"Economic instability and volatility have increased over the past few months, adding more uncertainty to an already challenging and unpredictable global business environment. Once again, Finance and Accounting is caught in the eye of the storm, with CFOs and those who report into them feeling the pressure," said BlackLine CEO Marc Huffman. "There is widespread acknowledgement that better visibility over financial data, processes and working capital is needed if organizations want to weather the storm. Company leaders across the world will need to carefully consider how their organization can respond and remain competitive, agile and resilient in the coming months."
Financial Data Under the Spotlight as Organizations Brace for Recession With external pressures that are hard to predict, real-time visibility over financial data, processes and working capital will be key to survival, leading to greater pressure on CFOs and those who report into them, according to the research.
Almost two thirds (62%) of C-suite and F&A professionals predict that their companies' financial reporting will come under increased scrutiny over the next year. More than six in ten (63%) believe that financing will be harder to secure, and a similar number (62%) expect the ability to view their companies' financial data in real time will be a "must-have" for business survival over the next 12 months. 
Against this backdrop, two in five (41%) CFOs said that they were responsible for ensuring their company's wellbeing during an economic downturn, compared to less than a third (30%) who said that this was the responsibility of their CEO. This indicates that as company finances come under the microscope, pressure to deliver insights to leadership in near-real time could weigh heavily on CFOs and the finance function.
The Biggest Pain Points When asked about the biggest pain points for the F&A currently, identifying manual/human errors during the month-end close process was a pressing issue for more than a third (36%) of overall respondents. More than a quarter (30%) also said they do not have enough automated controls for the volume of data they need to deal with. C-suite and F&A respondents said the three biggest challenges they will face in the coming year are:
- Increasing regulation and scrutiny
- Being able to provide accurate data quickly enough to help the organization respond to market changes
- Attracting and retaining talent

Looking Internally to Optimize Processes and Working Capital In response to increasing financial pressure, responses suggest that organizations now need to look internally for ways to optimize working capital and processes, with 40% saying they now need to find ways to optimize working capital without looking externally to borrow funds and 56% wanting to implement or scale automation solutions to help optimize and increase working capital within the next year.
Mr. Huffman continued: "There is no doubt that those who are using robust and comprehensive data to make rapid, intelligent decisions will be in a stronger position to adapt. In this environment, it's likely that greater emphasis than ever will be placed on the strategic insights that Finance and Accounting can offer the business."

HOUSTON and MIDLAND, Mich. , Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, WM (NYSE: WM) and Dow (NYSE: DOW) announced the launch of a bold new collaboration to improve residential recycling for hard-to-recycle plastic films by allowing consumers in select markets to recycle these materials directly in their curbside recycling. According to The Recycling Partnership, currently, only 1.9% of U.S. households 1 have access to curbside plastic film recycling, which is the plastic material with the lowest overall recycling rate. Once operating at full capacity, this program is expected to help WM divert more than 120,000 metric tons (MT) of plastics film from landfills annually.
This effort combines WM's broad reach as a comprehensive environmental solutions provider with Dow's leadership in material science to build new infrastructure that is intended to help close existing recycling gaps, driving a more circular value chain in the U.S. for plastic materials. The initiative has kicked off with an initial pilot program in the Chicago-area community of Hickory Hills, Ill., reaching approximately 3,500 households, with more cities to follow across the country. Consumers in the program's pilot cities will be able to recycle film plastics like bread bags, cling wrap, and dry-cleaning bags directly in their curbside recycling.
"By providing residential customers with a simple, curbside option for recycling plastic films, we will not only help our customers more easily manage their used plastic film products, but also meet the rising demand for recycled content products," said Jim Fish, president and CEO, WM. "We recognize that to continue to meet and exceed our sustainability goals, we need to continue to expand our circularity solutions. We see tremendous untapped potential to recycle and reuse plastic film, which many of our residential customers struggle to properly dispose." 
WM expects to invest over $800 million through 2025 to improve and enhance recycling infrastructure, including specialized technology that will allow WM to sort plastic films. WM will lead the collection and processing for the film recycling pilots and continue to identify film recycling opportunities across the U.S. By 2025, film recycling through WM is expected to reach 8% of U.S. households.
Dow is supporting this initiative by incorporating recycled content into its product solutions, in line with the company's ambitious, updated Transform the Waste sustainability commitment to deliver 3 million metric tons of circular and renewable solutions by 2030. Through material science expertise, offtakes, cart donations, technology and circular investments, Dow is working to increase recovery rates and drive towards a circular ecosystem for hard-to-recycle plastics.
"Enabling a circular economy requires broad stakeholder collaboration, innovation and investment throughout the value chain to continue to more rapidly develop and advance solutions at scale," said Jim Fitterling, Dow chairman and CEO. "Through our collaboration with WM, we're determined to launch new programs that grow recycling infrastructure and access nationwide, creating a more comprehensive system where films and flexible plastics form a key pillar of our circular product offerings."
"As an elected official and resident of Hickory Hills I am honored the City of Hickory Hills was chosen to participate in this new plastic film recycling program. The City of Hickory Hills is extremely excited to be a part of this latest recycling initiative," said D'Lorah Catizone, City Clerk for the City of Hickory Hills. "I think the things everyone can do are small things, but if they are done, it will eventually help the environment. I think recycling is the biggest effort we are making."
This collaboration builds on WM and Dow's continued support for a more expansive recycling system across the country. Earlier this year, WM announced its agreement to acquire a controlling interest in Avangard Innovative's U.S. post-consumer resin (or "PCR") business, creating Natura PCR – an independent company expected to scale and grow recycling capacity to produce an estimated 400 million pounds per year of PCR pellets in five years. Natura PCR is expected to provide circular solutions for films and clear plastic wrap used commercially, such as plastic stretch wrap for pallets, furniture film, grocery bags and potentially shrink wrap around food and beverage containers. Dow will continue to grow its REVOLOOP™ PCR product line while also increasing circular ecosystem projects with WM. Together, these projects will increase the recycling rate of plastics and create sustainable solutions in packaging, infrastructure and consumer applications.

Full text: University Headquarters has recently acquired cyber Degrees EDU and is now acquiring Discover Early Childhood EDU in order to increase the websites exposure among potential new early childhood teachers.
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- University Headquarters (UHQ), the internet's leading source for education and career information is announcing the acquisition of the site Discover Early Childhood EDU. This acquisition will focus on early childhood and will complement University HQ's already expansive educational offerings for future and current students. It is expected that UniversityHQ management will take advantage of this newly gained content to significantly expand its education portfolio beyond what they already offer, just as they did when the company acquired Cyber Degrees EDU recently. This is why the University HQ website is one of the most comprehensive options out there for those looking to review their degree and career options.
Higher education content is the specialty of University HQ. The website provides information about degrees, careers, colleges, and universities of all kinds. In considering their academic career path, students can benefit from detailed information covering a variety of higher education paths. Depending on the graduate's needs, University HQ may also provide details focused on licenses and certifications that may be vital for their success. UHQ's readers will be able to learn more about becoming a licensed early childhood education teacher in every state across the country following the acquisition of Discover Early Childhood Education. After all, each state has its own requirements and qualifications for various roles, such as special education teachers and school administrators, and students can use this site to learn about all the career opportunities they can choose from.
With the acquisition of Discover Early Childhood EDU and Cyber Degrees EDU, University HQ's information in both of these fields will be enhanced at every level. By integrating their existing and newly gained content, University HQ aims to give the readers all the information they need to succeed in early education and computer science or cyber security related fields. Research into these fields will also continue at UHQ. The website researchers and writers will also provide resources for professionals and students alike as new licensure requirements or career paths emerge.
UHQ knows the importance of providing students with information about all of their options, whether they are currently in the classroom or the workplace. For instance, those still in school may get additional gains from the knowledge that technology courses can be of aid to an educational professional, allowing them to easily adapt to new technologies in their own field. Additionally, many state boards offering educational licensure require more tests for various fields in education and different options for those who earn a graduate degree. Some may aim to earn a double major in education and science or English, while others focus on earning a bachelor's with an endorsement in special education or another specialty. When UHQ integrates the Discover Early Childhood EDU website with the existing information, students will be able to start out knowing exactly where they're headed.
University HQ's integration of Discover Early Education EDU will help students find the best degree program they can. University Headquarters' rankings include all the best education programs. These rankings include traditional, online, and hybrid degree programs. To come up with the objective rankings, UHQ researches educational statistics diligently from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, College Navigator and Payscale. In addition to these objective rankings, students can consider factors such as the nearby nightlife and their own subjective needs.
Students will benefit from the merging of Discover Early Education EDU and Cyber Degrees EDU thanks to University Headquarters' acquisition. The merger of Discover Early Education EDU and Cyber Degrees EDU with UHQ's existing content will give students information on education and cyber degrees which can serve them well for years to come. This merger makes University HQ even more of a one-stop repository of information for students and professionals looking to succeed in both early childhood education and cybersecurity.

Full text: ABI Research releases comprehensive sustainability assessment of telco technology suppliers
NEW YORK, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Sustainability Assessment: Telco Technology Suppliers by global technology intelligence firm ABI Research provides an unrivaled tool to identify partners best placed to help telcos drive sustainability initiatives as well as identify the best practice operations of suppliers that can be replicated. This unbiased examination of 81 telecommunications suppliers supporting telecommunication operator sustainability initiatives assesses vendors on sustainability criteria across nine categories, including 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) equipment, massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (mMIMO) antennae, Open RAN hardware and software, on-site renewable energy solutions, free cooling systems, liquid cooling systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven software, antenna solutions, and 5G cloud-native platforms. Sustainability initiatives were considered across two major dimensions; present-day implementation (the ability to scale impact), including the global rollout of 5G and market share of equipment, and forward-looking impact, evaluating the innovation of the technologies for reducing carbon emissions and waste, such as using next- generation silicon and integrating AI and Machine Learning (ML) to reduce the overall energy consumption of the equipment.
The results of the assessment highlight leaders in four different supplier groups:
- Traditional Network Equipment Vendors
- Non-traditional Network Equipment Vendors
- Chipset and Component Vendors
- Software Vendors

Across all the telco equipment categories, the leaders that demonstrated the most capabilities in their products and services for improving telecommunication operator's sustainability are Ericsson, Nokia, Huawei, ZTE, Samsung, Intel, Qualcomm, NEC, Mavenir, Cisco, Fujitsu, Rakuten Symphony, CommScope, Dell, AMD, IBM (Red Hat), VMware, Airspan, Parallel Wireless, and Schneider Electric.
According to Kim Johnson, Sustainable Technologies Principal Analyst at ABI Research, "ABI Research offers this comprehensive research as a tool to help select sustainable partners in the telecom industry and to identify industry best practices. With the evolution of network virtualization and cloudification, the total number of telco equipment vendors is growing. With this increase of potential partners, vendors must work together to optimize various layers and components of the networks, address soaring levels of 5G energy consumption, and respond to climate change industry-wide." 
ABI Research's overall assessment identified the providers with the greatest ability to scale sustainable impact across the industry. Based on this analysis, ABI Research concludes that, for now, the traditional network equipment vendors are likely to be the best positioned to help telcos improve their overall sustainability strategies and achieve climate targets.  "However, the other supplier groups are increasingly contributing to the sustainability of telco networks every day and should not be underestimated, given the complexities of the sustainability challenge and the innovation needed to advance to net zero carbon emissions," Johnson notes. The next most important grouping in the assessment is non-traditional network equipment vendors, while the third tier for reducing industry-wide carbon emissions and waste are the chipset and component vendors and software providers. One company that supersedes this classification is Intel, as an integrated device manufacturing (IDM) leader and technology provider that maintains legacy partnerships with traditional vendors and overlaps in multiple network areas.
Johnson highlights, "The companies that were identified as the most impactful industry-wide incorporate a multitude of sustainability initiatives. They employ eco-design principles, using less aluminum and other materials while making equipment lightweight, modular, and compact for simplified installation and tower sharing. The leaders are designing and making energy efficient radios and equipment with specialized silicon and integrated, intelligent, and programmable hardware and software."
The traditional leaders, Ericsson and Nokia, also have 5G smart factories recognized as "Global Lighthouse" manufacturing facilities and Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) pioneers by McKinsey and the World Economic Forum. The Ericsson USA 5G smart factory runs on 100% renewable energy with integrated environmental systems that reduce energy consumption by 24% and water use by 75%. Nokia's 5G "factory of the future" in Oulu, Finland, leverages Nokia's private wireless networks for secure and reliable connectivity for factory assets, IoT analytics, and a real-time digital twin of factory operations data. 
"In addition to supporting sustainable manufacturing and operational practices, all the companies in the Sustainability Assessment are focused on breaking the 5G energy curve. These companies are leading the way for advancing network technologies and performance while reducing energy consumption and global carbon emissions," Johnson concludes.
These findings are from ABI Research's Sustainability Assessment: Telco Technology Suppliers report. This report is part of the company's Sustainable Technologies research service, which provides actionable research and data designed to help companies go from sustainability pledges to sustainability execution by identifying technologies, vendors, and programs that accelerate sustainability efforts, such as reducing carbon emissions and waste.

Full text: Pharmacists can assess eligible COVID-19 positive patients and prescribe oral antiviral medication at most locations
CVS Pharmacy first to offer the service nationwide
WOONSOCKET, R.I., Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- CVS Pharmacy ® today announced that pharmacists at more than 9,000 CVS Pharmacy locations can clinically assess COVID-19 positive patients and, if eligible, prescribe Paxlovid, an oral antiviral treatment. In July, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognized the clinical capabilities of pharmacists and granted them the authority to evaluate patients with COVID-19 and prescribe Paxlovid to clinically eligible patients. After evaluating the FDA's guidance and implementing required systems, policies, and training, CVS Pharmacy is now offering the service in 49 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. 
CVS Pharmacists can assess eligible COVID-19 positive patients and prescribe oral antivirals at most locations "Enabling pharmacists to evaluate patients and prescribe Paxlovid when clinically appropriate increases patient access and reduces barriers to care and treatment for those who need it," said Prem Shah, PharmD, Executive Vice President, CVS Health ® , and President and Chief Pharmacy Officer, CVS Pharmacy. "Paxlovid has proven to be an important tool in the fight against COVID-19 by helping to reduce the severity of symptoms in patients at high risk for severe cases of the illness."
Accessing COVID-19 care and treatment at CVS Pharmacy  
Symptomatic patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 can visit CVS.com or the CVS Pharmacy app to seek care and potential treatment through an over-the-phone assessment with their local pharmacist. Prior to clinical assessment by a pharmacist, patients are asked to complete a series of screening questions online to determine eligibility and must attest to having tested positive for COVID-19.
"One of the important benefits of this service is the convenience it affords our patients," Shah continued. "We are already seeing that some patients can log into the digital scheduler, schedule an appointment, be evaluated by a pharmacist, and receive their medication in just a few hours, which is critical for this medication to be effective."
For a pharmacist to prescribe Paxlovid to clinically eligible patients, the patient must have had certain bloodwork performed in the past 12 months and must provide supporting documentation or electronic records. Pharmacists are required to review a patient's kidney and liver blood test values before prescribing Paxlovid. Not all pharmacist assessments will result in a prescription. Data provided by the patient during the eligibility screening, as well as notes from the pharmacist's assessment, are securely stored in the patient's electronic health record and shared with their primary care provider ensuring continuity of care across the patient's health care team.
Patients who opt to seek clinical assessment and treatment for COVID-19 from a CVS pharmacist are responsible for an upfront payment, which varies by insurance.  Due to federal regulations, patient care services provided by pharmacists are not covered by Medicare or certain state Medicaid plans, and CVS Pharmacy is unable to bill for these services. For more information, visit CVS.com.
Helping prevent the spread of COVID-19
In addition to pharmacists evaluating and treating COVID-19 positive patients, select CVS Pharmacy and MinuteClinic ® locations are offering bivalent COVID-19 booster doses to adults and children five years of age and older. Appointments at CVS Pharmacy can be scheduled digitally through CVS.com or the CVS Pharmacy app, and appointments at MinuteClinic can be scheduled through MinuteClinic.com, with times available seven days a week, including evening and weekend hours. 
Bivalent vaccines offer better protection against COVID-19 caused by the omicron variant and have been authorized for use as a single booster dose at least two months after primary or booster vaccination. The CDC has said that COVID-19 vaccinations may be co-administered with the flu vaccination. The digital scheduler allows patients to schedule a bivalent COVID-19 booster and flu vaccination during the same visit. 
Meeting at-home COVID-19 testing needs
With the likelihood of cold, flu and COVID-19 cases increasing as winter approaches, CVS Pharmacy has ensured ample supply of at-home COVID-19 tests kits. Available tests include a new CVS Health 1 brand test that features a QR code with a link to instructions for a pharmacist assessment for Paxlovid when testing positive. At-home COVID-19 tests can be secured through a patient's prescription benefit plan or by paying out-of-pocket and can be purchased in-store, purchased online and delivered, or purchased online and picked up in store at no cost. Because commercial, Medicare and Medicaid plans vary, patients should contact their insurance provider to confirm their coverage policy and claims submission process.

Full text: Patent-pending Context-Augmented Machine Learning (CAML) brings logic and reasoning to artificial intelligence use cases—and has already allowed one Dynam.AI client to autonomously monitor oil and gas facilities for loss of containment.
SAN DIEGO, Nov.15, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Dynam.AI, an artificial intelligence (AI) software development firm automating critical decision-making for the industrial sector, today announced a groundbreaking capability available to all clients: Context Augmented Machine Learning (CAML). CAML leverages scientific "first principles" and the laws of physics, human behavior, and macroeconomic conditions to simulate the physical world for more realistic, trustworthy analytics. This allows industrial businesses to automate manual processes, improving their critical decision making and increasing ROI with fewer resources. Dynam.AI's in-house development platform, using the patent-pending CAML method, has been proven to speed up AI model development for clients by up to 65%.
"We have solved some previously unsolvable industry challenges for our clients using CAML, and are excited to introduce this groundbreaking AI capability to the industrial sector," said Diana Shapiro, CEO of Dynam.AI. "Dynam.AI is a team of data scientists and engineers who are passionate about advancing artificial intelligence. Our novel data science methods and in-house platform empower us to complete projects faster, more accurately, and with less data. CAML is just one of the tools we have in our workbench to partner with clients—but it's one that will improve the discipline of machine learning as we know it."
What CAML Does
CAML combines existing data and models to expand features for analysis, introducing common-sense information that a human would innately use but a non-human algorithm would not, such as the laws of physics. It allows Dynam.AI to do two important things for clients: 1.) create richer data models for AI solutions that are smarter and better able to adapt to the real world, and 2.) solve data "cold cases" that traditional machine learning methods are unable to crack.
"Traditional machine learning is only able to work with the data it's given," said Dimtiry Fisher, Chief Scientific Officer at Dynam.AI. "Not all data sets or data collection methods are created equal, and none of them are perfect. This is why it can take so long to develop AI solutions for the industrial sector that actually do what they're supposed to, such as detect anomalies or optimize a process. But when your AI has access to scientific first principles, it can use the data it's given much more efficiently and effectively. This translates into better results with available data, and results that cannot be obtained based on data alone, leading to better decision intelligence and better solution performance."
CAML aids developers and data scientists who are working on projects in object detection, medical imaging, sensor fusion, predictive diagnostics, satellite, and aerial imaging, thermography, anomaly detection, and much more. This capability has allowed Dynam.AI clients to solve long-standing problems with image and sensor data, developing solutions up to 65% faster.
How Dynam.AI Clients are Using CAML
The Dynam.AI team recently helped American Robotics, a subsidiary of Ondas Holdings, Inc., advance their AI-powered anomaly detection and alerts, which flag loss of containment in oil and gas operations. American Robotics, which is the first company approved by the FAA to operate commercial drones remotely, has worked with Dynam.AI using CAML to create a capability to detect and identify potential oil leaks early, i.e. loss of containment. These new loss of containment capabilities will enable automatic detection of hydrocarbon losses at oil and gas facilities, ensuring worker safety and mitigating potential environmental, financial and reputational risk.
"American Robotics and Ondas Holdings are valued partners of Dynam.AI, and this project demonstrates the benefit of using first principles in conjunction with machine learning," said Shapiro. "We look forward to sharing the many other exciting advances we are helping our industry clients progress using context augmentation."

More than half of businesses know they have capacity within their teams, but don't know where it is or how to access it.
NEW YORK, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- It's time for US businesses to release 'hidden' capacity within their organizations, a new report from ActiveOps, a leading management process automation company , has revealed. Getting a true picture of real-time capacity within an organization will enable operations leaders in the US financial and banking sector to unlock time and resources that can be better spent, helping teams to do more with what they have during recession.
This comes as the new report,  Are you recession ready? How to do more with less , reveals that 53% of US businesses know they have spare capacity within their organization but don't know where, or how to access it. However due to a lack of insight into workload volumes and day-to-day operations, leaders are unable to make critical decisions or respond to spikes in demand due to a lack of operational agility. This could ultimately cause businesses to fall short of organizational objectives, costing revenue and profit.
Importantly, 52% of employees also believe that their business needs better forecasting and planning during a recession; indicating that a combination of better foresight and insights into day-to-day operations will be key to supporting employees and responding to customers when circumstances change rapidly.
Other key findings of ActiveOps' research include:
-  Two in five senior employees don't have the information needed to improve productivity and efficiency
- 28% of employees can't see when people are working
- 25% of employees lack intra-day insights to make timely decisions
- 91% of businesses are yet to begin recession preparations, and the further away an organization's preparations are for recession, the more confident they felt that they have the information needed to make decisions to improve productivity and efficiency.

Building resilience and agility into operations will be crucial for organizations, particularly in the finance sector. Leaders will need to facilitate a culture of cross-team collaboration to support overworked teams, clear backlog and enable flexibility when the unexpected happens. In order to unlock capacity, leaders must have an accurate overview of capacity within their organization by analyzing the work teams and individuals are doing to understand where capacity is hiding.
As well as supporting internal teams, addressing the workload challenge and finding ways to do more with less while prioritizing employees, it is vital to maintain customer service. Leaders must not only source additional, existing capacity, but also prioritize cross-training and reskilling of employees to remove skills-based bottlenecks and make it easier for teams to borrow and lend resources.
The ActiveOps' report signifies challenges ahead for US businesses particularly in the finance sector; and surveyed 1,000 employees within operations teams across North America, UK and Australia. The US financial services sector is one of the largest and accounts for a total of 7.4% of US GDP. 
Commenting on the findings, Richard Jeffery, Chief Executive Officer at ActiveOps  said: "A recession is looming, and a trend we're predicting is that businesses will need to optimize the resources, staff and solutions that they currently have, to boost organizational visibility and become more resilient."
"Businesses need to know as much as possible about how work is done, how long it takes and how employees spend their time. This will enable operations teams to respond more effectively to spikes in demand, make the right decisions and keep things moving when recession bites. Investing in technology is key to this. Technology that identifies opportunities for improvement and enhances transparency can save time and resources by identifying efficiencies, prioritizing workloads and facilitating collaboration across teams. It will also support customer needs and employee demands throughout recession."
"Now is the time to unlock your capacity and gain a better understanding of processes, to enable you to trim the fat while strengthening the muscle of your operations teams – and your business."

"Growing industrial demand for chemical separation agents, chemical recovery agents, and efficient catalyst carrier "
The cost of chemical separation and the catalyst carrier process is increasing, which is leading to increased demand for cost-efficient and reliant solutions. For many chemical reactions, catalysts such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium are expensive components, which force industries to use these catalysts wisely. Also, the costly solvent recovery is a major challenge for industries.
Extremely high surface area and the adsorption capacity of activated carbon fiber bring about an efficient separation process. The ﬁbers in the activated composite materials are rigidly connected to create an open, porous, stiff monolith that can be shaped into a relatively close shape, which can separate chemical elements as per requirements.
"Growing demand from personal protective equipment and protective clothing industry"
Chemical protective suits made of ACF are flexible, lightweight, compatible with several washing and overcome the limitations of ACS-based suits. As a result, the market for protective garments has seen an increase in demand for ACF. The healthcare industry has been witnessing substantial growth in Asia Pacific and Middle Eastern countries, with significant investments being made for the development of the industry. As a result, it is anticipated that the need for protective gear for medical use would rise in the coming years.
"Need for environment-favourable process of production"
Considering the environmental impact of ACF production, different types of biomass have started to replace synthetic fiber as a raw material for ACF manufacturing. Making use of biomass not only addresses environmental issues, but it is also creating wealth from agricultural wastes at the same time. The expansion of the market would likely be impacted by disruptions across supply chains and fluctuating prices of raw materials of ACF, such as synthetic fiber, which is non-degradable and tends to bind with particles of dangerous chemical pollutants, such as flame retardants and pesticides. The development of an environment favourable process is a major challenge faced by activated carbon fiber market.

- Covers Eligo unique ability to engineer and functionalize skin microbiome resident bacteria, Cutibacterium acnes
- Supports Eligo's lead program in moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris with POC clinical data in 2024
- Allows explorations in other serious skin disorders and potential vaccination and desensitization approaches

PARIS, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Eligo Bioscience today announced the issuance by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) of the first patent in a wide family covering genetic engineering of a key skin microbiome species, Cutibacterium acnes , to support therapeutic interventions in multiple serious skin disorders. This pioneering work also provides unique opportunities to leverage the skin's immune system for oncological, vaccination or desensitization applications.
US Patent #11,473,093 stems from the WO2022096596 patent family filed in 2020 and fully owned by Eligo Bioscience that covers the use of genetically engineered C. acnes and any derived products to address skin disorders, and an exploration of the potential of leveraging the skin's immune system for oncological, vaccination or desensitization applications. No genetic toolbox was yet in existence for this notoriously difficult-to-engineer bacterial species before Eligo achieved these long-awaited genetic engineering breakthroughs. Indeed, over the last three years, Eligo has developed unique capabilities and know-how that provide significant potential, not only to engineer C. acnes in the lab, but also to functionalize C. acnes directly on the skin of patients in order to impact host responses.
C. acnes is a key and ubiquitous species of the skin microbiome that provides many health benefits for the host, such as maintenance of skin barrier and protection against pathogens. Interestingly, it also resides in the hair follicle, in the vicinity of the host immune and stem cells. Using its versatile gene editing platform, and supported by this additional patent family, Eligo is in the position to either eliminate or modify genes from the skin microbiome, or introduce new genes to the microbiome to express therapeutic proteins at the skin/host interface. Eligo has already obtained preclinical proof of concept for its first program in moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris with the development of a first-in-class modality capable of delivering a CRISPR system directly into C. acnes , to kill with high efficiency only the strains of this species that are known to drive inflammation in the hair follicle. Eligo is progressing this program rapidly, with an expected clinical proof of concept in moderate-to-severe acne patients in 2024. Patent family WO2022096596 fully supports Eligo's acne program and many other serious skin disorders such as skin cancer, alopecia and vitiligo, as well as a tool for potential vaccination and desensitization.
"Thanks to the quality of our science and the unmatched expertise of our team, we have been able to develop unique and highly differentiated tools to address skin disorders in record time. We are extremely proud of the pioneering work accomplished by the team, now recognized by the USPTO, and that offers Eligo a dominant position in the field of C.acnes genetic engineering and its vast therapeutic applications," said Dr. Xavier Duportet, Chief Executive Officer of Eligo Bioscience. "The grant of this first patent is a very important milestone for the company as we progress towards the clinic with our proprietary modality in the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris".

Full text: More than half of accessible HCPs engage via video and in-person
Access is selective as most meet with three companies or less
PLEASANTON, Calif., Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Veeva Systems (NYSE: VEEV) today released the latest Veeva Pulse Field Trends Report, the largest and most complete analysis of healthcare professional (HCP) access across the biopharma industry. Data show U.S. HCP access now averages 60% across therapeutic areas and is nearing 80% in key specialties, driven by the increasing use of video meetings to complement in-person visits.
These new findings underscore the impact of digital as more than 50% of accessible HCPs now engage via video along with in-person and the addition of video is shown to generate 3x promotional response as well as increased in-person meeting frequency. This combination of reach, channel preference, and effectiveness is even more critical as half of accessible HCPs limit engagement to three companies or less.
"The last few years have pushed us to reevaluate our field force strategy and find better ways of maintaining successful HCP relationships," said Kate Greengrove, head of commercial operations at GSK. "With HCP access back on the rise and in new ways than before, Veeva Pulse proves that digitally-enabled reps create a better experience for customers, are more efficient in educating prescribers, and are better connected to our overall brand strategy through cross-channel engagement."
Latest Veeva Pulse data show combination of video and in-person meetings maximize field access:
- Higher access boosted by video meetings: Field access now averages 60%, up from roughly 20% during the pandemic. Increased access is driven by the use of video and in-person, preferred by more than half of all accessible HCPs—and is even higher in key specialties like oncology, where 78% of access is via video and in-person.
- HCPs are more selective: Half of accessible HCPs limit their engagement to three or fewer biopharmas. Most oncologists meet with three companies or less and 30% of psychiatrists limit access to just one. In contrast, 70% of immunologists engage with four or more companies.
- Using video with in-person engagement expands reach: HCPs meet with companies more frequently when video is used. In oncology, HCPs engaging through video and in-person meet with reps more than twice as much as reps using in-person only.
- Highest impact field teams are digitally enabled and maximize time spent with HCPs:  The most successful field teams host up to 40% more meetings, use content nearly five times as much, and drive up to 80% more new patient starts.

"Veeva Pulse Field Trends Report gives a comprehensive view into HCP access and channel effectiveness industrywide so teams know what actions they can take to strengthen engagement and drive better outcomes," said Dan Rizzo, vice president of Veeva business consulting. "Seeing how access has changed and the impact of digital, companies are rethinking their targeting and channel mix and how to best equip the field to deliver the most relevant, impactful engagement across specialties."
About the Veeva Pulse Field Trends Report Analyzing over 600 million HCP interactions and activities annually from more than 80% of commercial biopharma field teams worldwide, the Veeva Pulse Field Trends Report is the largest industry benchmark of its kind on HCP engagement. The analysis compiles real-time transactional data recorded in Veeva CRM to deliver a view of engagement activity across life sciences. Indexed by Veeva quarterly, the data will help companies effectively and accurately benchmark performance to set the right, actionable goals for continued growth and impact.

Full text: - Agreement to accelerate development of a 'Gut-on-a-Chip' tissue model to improve therapeutic choice and outcome of ulcerative colitis patients
- CollPlant to fund development and receive exclusive license to manufacture and commercialize human intestine tissue model
- Intestine model highlights vast application possibilities for rhCollagen and CollPlant's strategic expansion into personalized medicine, an emerging approach for disease treatment

REHOVOT, Israel, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --  CollPlant  (NASDAQ: CLGN), a regenerative and aesthetic medicine company developing innovative human collagen-based technologies and products, together with Ramot, the Technology Transfer Company of Tel Aviv University and Sheba Medical Center, a hospital ranked by Newsweek magazine as one of the Top 10 world best hospitals for the 4 th consecutive year (2019-2022), today announced entering into a license and research agreement to co-develop a 'Gut-on-a-Chip' tissue model for drug discovery and high throughput screening of drugs. The model is intended to be used in personal medicine applications for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease affecting millions of individuals worldwide. The in-vitro intestine-on-chip platform combines CollPlant's human recombinant collagen (rhCollagen) with other proprietary biomaterials and human cells. Designed to emulate the human intestine tissue, the 3D bioprinted model will allow medical professionals to identify drug targets and personalized therapeutic responses that can lead to improved patient outcomes.
The collaboration draws upon CollPlant's expertise in high precision 3D bioprinting and collagen-based bioinks for scalable and reproducible biofabrication of human tissues, with Tel Aviv University's 'smart' Organ-on-a-Chip platform and Sheba Medical Center's capabilities in advanced treatment screening. The co-development is led by Dr. Ben Maoz from Tel Aviv University, who completed his post-doctoral fellowship under the supervision of Prof. Don Ingber and Prof. Kit Parker at the Wyss Institute at Harvard University, Dr. Yael Haberman from the Pediatric Gastroenterology unit of Sheba Medical Center, and CollPlant's team of scientists and engineers. Under the terms of the agreement, CollPlant will fund the development of the intestine model and receive an exclusive manufacturing and commercial license and Tel Aviv University and Sheba will receive sales royalties from CollPlant.  
"We are excited to embark on this important collaboration with Tel Aviv University and Sheba Medical Center for what will represent CollPlant's strategic expansion into personalized medicine. These acclaimed institutes are ideal partners to accelerate the development of representative models of the human intestine," said Yehiel Tal, CollPlant's Chief Executive Officer. "Current models of inflammatory bowel diseases such as colitis do not accurately mimic the intestine tissue structure with the induced disease, and consequently have limited applicability in predicting therapeutic response. We believe the 3D bioprinted human intestine chip has the potential to accelerate new drug development, reduce costs, support development of personalized, highly effective treatments for ulcerative colitis and significantly reduce or eliminate the need for animal testing."
Keren Primor Cohen, the CEO of Ramot at The Tel Aviv University, stated: "I am highly looking forward to our collaboration with CollPlant and Sheba Medical Center, and we are very proud of the innovative technology of Dr. Ben Maoz and his research team. This reusable, modular organ-on-a-chip platform allows co-culturing and overcomes scientific data collection and imaging challenges posed by other in-market alternatives, that pushes the industry another step forward in the direction of personalized treatment".
Dr. Yael Haberman (MD, PhD) at Sheba Medical Center, stated: "I am very much looking forward to our collaboration with CollPlant and Tel Aviv University, where we aim to generate a complex model system that will mimic gut epithelial barrier functions and will enable preclinical testing and screening of different interventions."
Ulcerative colitis is characterized by chronic inflammation and a relapsing and remitting clinical course that requires lifelong treatment. Patients respond differently or fail to respond to therapies, resulting in exposure of patients to unjustified drugs and delay of the institution of effective treatment.

Full text: SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Magnachip Semiconductor Corporation ("Magnachip") (NYSE: MX) announced today that the company has launched its first Power Management Integrated Circuit (PMIC) for IT devices equipped with OLED screens.
A PMIC is a core component to supply power to electronic devices. It plays an increasingly important role as the battery life of handheld IT devices like laptops and tablets is highly dependent on power efficiency.
Based on Magnachip's integrated power IC technology, this newly-designed PMIC communicates with a system by using an Inter-Integrated Circuit (I 2 C). Therefore, it can control functions such as output voltage control, ON/OFF block, output voltage sequence management, protection circuit fault flag, and switching frequency transition -- all of which offer seamless connectivity and outstanding performance.
The fast transient response of this PMIC supports a variable refresh rate. This allows a screen to adjust how often it refreshes the image to match the frame rate without user input. This feature greatly reduces power consumption and enables a smooth and comfortable viewing experience for games and high-quality videos at refresh rates of 60Hz~240Hz.
In addition, the power circuit can be simple and compact. This new IC incorporates one boost regulator for the power supply to source and gate drivers, one low dropout (LDO) regulator, two voltage reference operational amplifiers, three negative output LDO regulators, three high-current buck regulators for power supply to a timing controller and two operational amplifiers for the gamma buffer. This level of integration results in smaller and faster electronic circuits. Engineered with strong circuit protection, this PMIC also provides over-voltage protection, short circuit protection, thermal shutdown, under voltage lockout, over current detection, over current shutdown and clamping circuit.
Omdia, a global market research firm, estimates that the OLED panel shipments for laptops will grow 44.3% annually from 6.3 million substrates in 2022 to 39.2 million substrates by 2027. The research firm also expects that OLED panels for tablet PCs will be shipped from 3.9 million substrates this year to 24.2 million substrates in 2027.
"The expansion of OLED applications in IT devices is expected to continue," said YJ Kim, CEO of Magnachip. "Magnachip will extend its premium PMIC product line through technological validation for a wide range of IT applications to address changing market demand and design requirements."

Full text: All styles within the PXG x Nick Jonas Collection are now available for purchase online and at all PXG retail locations.
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Today, PXG is pleased to announce the official drop of its first-ever apparel collaboration, the PXG X NJ Capsule Collection. Teaming up with global pop icon and self-proclaimed golf nut Nick Jonas, the collection delivers a modern, golf-inspired fashion lineup perfect for the golf course or anywhere you choose to play.
"I am beyond thrilled to finally release this collection and provide our customers and Nick's fans with a golf apparel and accessories collection that marries fashion and function," said Renee Parsons, President and Executive Creative Director of PXG Apparel. "From the highest quality performance materials and custom colorways to carefully chosen logo placement and impeccable fit and feel, the PXG x Nick Jonas Collection embodies golf lifestyle, the way myself and Nick envision it."
The PXG X NJ Capsule Collection is influenced by Parsons' and Jonas' shared love for golf and fashion. The limited-edition line combines luxe materials, striking graphic designs, and highly technical detailing to create unbelievably comfortable and on-trend golf clothing and accessories. From bags and hats to socks, slides, polos, and pants, the line offers performance and style for both golfers and fashion enthusiasts alike.
The limited-edition collection offers 15 apparel styles and nine accessories that are now available for purchase online and at all 19 PXG retail locations – PXG Atlanta, PXG Boston, PXG Chicago North, PXG Chicago West, PXG Dallas, PXG Denver, PXG Detroit, PXG Fairfax, PXG Houston, PXG Indianapolis, PXG Mesa, PXG Minneapolis, PXG Orlando, PXG Paramus, PXG Philadelphia, PXG North Phoenix, PXG Scottsdale, PXG Seattle, and PXG Westgate. With retail stores across the country and online shopping at PXG.com and Trendygolf.com, PXG has made it easy for customers to shop the collection, including Nick's hand-selected must-have looks.
While each piece brings a newfound boldness and unique edge to sporty apparel, all styles within the drop continue to uphold the highly technical and functional features PXG Apparel has become known for. Most golf shirts in the collection are available in two fits, Comfort Fit and Athletic Fit, to ensure optimal comfort and playability, while a third fit, the "Nick Fit", has also been introduced to fit wider shoulders with narrow waists. With performance, hybrid, and après golf looks, the PXG x NJ Capsule Collection has something for everyone.

ABOUT PARSONS XTREME GOLF

ABOUT NICK JONAS
After electrifying music from multiple angles, appearing in blockbuster films, and launching successful business ventures, Nick Jonas still challenges himself and popular culture. Of course, his story as one- third of Jonas Brothers remains well-documented—especially given the band's chart-dominating 2019 comeback Happiness Begins, sold out tours, and subsequent GRAMMY® Award nomination. At the same time, he established himself as a dynamic solo artist with a penchant for breaking boundaries. 2014's self-titled Nick Jonas yielded the triple-platinum "Jealous," double-platinum "Chains," and gold- certified "Levels." Its 2016 follow-up Last Year Was Complicated spawned the anthem "Close" [feat. Tove Lo] and brought his streams into the billions. In 2017, he contributed the Golden Globe® Award- nominated "Home" to the Ferdinand soundtrack. Meanwhile, his songwriting would be recognized with the prestigious Hal David Starlight Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2016. Along the way, he also captivated audiences as a re-occurring judge on NBC's The Voice and in big screen favorites such as Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, UglyDolls, Midway, Jumanji: The Next Level, Chaos Walking and more.
In 2021, Nick released his studio album Spaceman [Island Records]. In 2022, Nick joined NBC's new competitive dance series Dancing With Myself as a judge alongside Shakira and Liza Koshy.

Ranked first in multi-line insurance & brokerage industry in APAC
HONG KONG and SHANGHAI, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. ("Ping An" or the "Group", HKEx:2318; SSE:601318) announced that it has been rated A in the Morgan Stanley Capital Investment's (MSCI) 2022 ESG Ratings, ranking the first in multi-line insurance & brokerage industry in APAC. The upgrade from BBB last year recognizes Ping An's outstanding performance in the area of "Access to Finance", and substantial improvements in "Responsible Investment, Climate Change Vulnerability, Corporate Governance and Corporate Behavior". Ping An's consistent implementations on responsible investment initiatives with a five-year green finance target also contributed to its score, according to the MSCI ESG Rating report.
Supporting development of the real economy and innovations in inclusive finance
Ping An maintains a "people-centric" philosophy, strengthening financial support in areas such as developing the real economy, small, medium and micro enterprises, and agriculture, rural areas and farmers. Using a combination of insurance funds, bank credit and asset management, and other financial resources, Ping An has invested over RMB5.9 trillion to support the real economy as of September 30, 2022. Through the Ping An Rural Communities Support program, the Group has provided nearly RMB50 billion for poverty alleviation and industrial revitalization as of September 30, 2022.
Ping An's pursuit of innovation of insurance products aims to make insurance as an economic "shock absorber" and a social "stabilizer". For example, Ping An Property & Casualty created Catastrophe Parametric Insurance, which makes use of heavy rainfall and typhoon data as parameters for insurance payouts. Once the compensation conditions are met, the compensation amount can be determined without on-site inspection and damage assessment, which helps accelerate post-disaster reconstruction and resumption of business operations. With accumulated insurance payouts in Guangdong province reaching nearly RMB300 million over past five years, the Group's innovations in insurance have supported rapid reconstruction and resumption of production in disaster-stricken areas and improved climate risk management capabilities.
Promoting responsible investment and green finance
Ping An is committed to promoting green finance and green development. It is supporting China's goals to peak carbon emission by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 through its green finance initiative. In 2021, Ping An announced its targets of annual growth rates for its green investments of no less than 20%, green insurance premiums no less than 70% and green credit balance no less than 20%. Ping An aims to achieve the overall targets by 2025, with investments and credit of RMB400 billion and total green insurance premiums of RMB250 billion. As of September 30, 2022, Ping An's green investment and financing totaled approximately RMB319.8 billion, and its green banking business totaled RMB184.2 billion. Premium income of environmentally sustainable insurance products totaled approximately RMB110.5 billion in the first nine months of 2022.
Ping An was the first financial company in mainland China to release a TCFD (Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures) report in 2019. It identified the types of climate change-related risks, time dimensions, impact levels and business segments involved. It assessed the exposure to banking and investment climate risks, and mitigated climate change-related financial risks by deploying green and low-carbon assets and reducing the investment proportion of brown assets.
Integrating  Core ESG Philosophies into Corporate Governance
Ping An has integrated the core philosophies and environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) standards into its corporate management, drawing on international best practices. It has built a professional sustainability management framework to guide its business practices. The Board of Directors of Ping An developed and followed the Board Diversity Policy
to ensure a balance of Board members in terms of skills, experience and diversified perspectives, and thus to elevate the efficiency of the Board and maintain a high level of corporate governance, drive business reform, prevent risks and protect investors' rights. Upholding the principle of openness and transparency in information disclosure, Ping An has improved its corporate value and maintained constructive communications with shareholders and investors. It has strengthened mutual trust with the capital markets by proactively communicating key business achievements, including implementation of integrated finance strategies and its healthcare ecosystem strategy, and initiatives to maintain strong customer relationships.
Ping An will continue to integrate social values in its businesses to provide customers with "worry-free, time-saving, and money-saving" experiences in finance and healthcare services. The Group will further improve and implement ESG-related policies, enhance ESG governance and focus on sustainable development strategies – growing value for customers, employees, shareholders, and society.

Full text: VANCOUVER, BC, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Debrand, a reverse logistics textile solutions provider, today announced that it has received a strategic investment from WM, North America's largest environmental solutions provider. This is the first strategic investment made by WM in textile recycling. Leveraging Debrand's expertise and technology, WM expects to offer new textile recycling capabilities for its customers and provide circular solutions across North America. The investment positions Debrand for expansive growth. The terms of the investment agreement were not disclosed.
With a reputation for exceptional service and breakthrough innovations, Debrand specializes in reverse logistics for the fashion and retail industry. The company is headquartered in Vancouver, Canada and customers include Lululemon Athletica, Canada Goose, Aritzia, Kit and Ace, IKEA Canada, and Everlane.
"We work with our customers to unlock the highest-value for their products by extending the products' life through reuse or recycling," said Amelia Eleiter, co-founder of Debrand. "Not only will WM's investment allow us to integrate our solutions at scale across North America, but we will also be able to empower new and existing customers' to run efficient and profitable circular systems."
This year, Debrand is projected to divert nearly 1,000 tons of used textiles (125% year-over-year growth), from landfills through resale, recycling and repurposing channels. The investment from WM will accelerate Debrand's plans to grow its operations, capabilities, customer network, and team in support of both existing and new customers, while continuing to deliver on the company's reputation for best-in-class solutions, quality, and customer service.
"Our customers are looking for ways to reduce waste from their operations, enhance their sustainability reporting, and accelerate the transition to a circular economy," said Eric Dixon, Vice President of Sustainability and Environmental Solutions at WM. "WM, in turn, is continuing to adapt to meet these needs and become a true sustainability partner to our customers." 
"After working with Debrand, we recognized the immense value of their cutting-edge textile allocation technology that has enabled us to enhance sortation and divert our customers' textile waste from landfills into circular solutions. Over 17 million tons of used textile waste are generated annually in the U.S., and our investment in Debrand will help rapidly grow and scale textile solutions and innovation across North America," said Dixon.
Significant demand and growth is expected for Debrand's reverse logistics textile solutions in response to climate change and the movement towards a circular economy. The fashion industry is one of the highest producers of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally, and a growing number of brands have committed to adopting circular strategies to reduce GHG emissions that derive from producing fibers and raw materials. World leaders and organizations, such as NATO, have also pledged their commitment to reducing emissions by at least 45% by 2030. Consumers and regulators are putting pressure on companies to embrace circular business models to alleviate the burden on already stressed natural resources and move towards a sustainable future.
"I am excited and honored that WM has made this investment in our company, team, and technology," said Eleiter. "With their support, we will be able to scale our business and help even more companies transform the way they process returned and surplus inventory by eliminating waste and inefficiencies and prioritizing reuse, recycle and resale opportunities."

- Up to 2.5x more power dense and half the weight and size than comparable solutions, APC Smart-UPS Ultra delivers more power in less space, freeing up valuable IT space for edge applications
- Lithium-ion technology means less time and OpEx spent on battery maintenance
- Flexible mounting options including rack, tower, wall or ceiling enable it to be placed out of the way to allow for more space for IT equipment
- EcoStruxure™ Ready cloud-based monitoring optimises performance and enables anytime, anywhere UPS monitoring

LONDON, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Schneider Electric™, the leader in digital transformation of energy management and automation, today introduced in Europe APC™ Smart-UPS™ Ultra, the industry's first 3kW and 5kW 1U single-phase Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS). Designed to deliver more power, flexibility, and intelligent monitoring in the smallest footprint, the APC Smart-UPS Ultra enables IT professionals and solution providers to address many of the challenges with deploying IT infrastructure in distributed edge computing environments and at the edge.
The global edge computing market is facing massive growth, growing at 12.5% annually to an estimated $250.6 billion in 2024, according to IDC. The proliferation of digital technologies and smart applications is driving the need for compute, network, and storage resources that are localised and in close proximity to enable business critical processes and experiences that rely on network connectivity to the cloud. Yet, configuring, deploying, and maintaining the supporting IT infrastructure for multiple, geographically dispersed sites comes with unique challenges.
With the APC Smart-UPS Ultra, Schneider Electric is bringing to market its smallest, most advanced single-phase UPS that provides the flexibility to install anywhere and save on total cost of ownership (TCO) without compromising businesses' power protection needs.
"To meet the digital demands of the future, local, regional and cloud data centres must be designed to be sustainable, resilient, efficient and adaptable. Schneider Electric continues to innovate and respond to customer needs with the introduction of the APC Smart-UPS Ultra,"  said Tarunjeet Sarao, Senior Vice President, Transactional & Edge Line of Business at Schneider Electric.  "The first of its kind, APC Smart-UPS Ultra is redefining the single-phase UPS, making it lighter and more powerful with the next generation semiconductor technology. In addition, it uses lithium-ion technology to power distributed IT and edge computing sites to ensure our digital life is on."
APC Smart-UPS delivers more power in less space
In distributed IT and edge environments there are often significant physical space considerations, with a premium placed on maximising square footage and operating the space efficiently to optimise IT systems and improve the bottom line.
The APC Smart-UPS Ultra's compact design delivers more power while taking up less IT space, providing the installation flexibility and power density you need for today and into the future. The UPS's compact design is up to 50% smaller and lighter than comparable UPS solutions on the market today. The APC Smart-UPS Ultra offers flexible mounting options including rack, tower or wall/ceiling mounts, so it can be placed out of the way to allow for more space for IT in the rack.
Lithium-ion battery offers lower TCO over 10 years, reducing site visits
Effective power management is critical for any IT environment, but regular and effective maintenance of power protection equipment such as UPSs, especially across multiple distributed sites, can require costly ongoing OpEx investment.
The APC Smart-UPS Ultra's Lithium-ion battery lasts up to three times longer than a traditional valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) powered UPS and will not need to be replaced under normal operating conditions. This helps to eliminate costly battery replacement, labor and service fees and visits over the life of the UPS. The APC Smart-UPS Ultra saves on TCO over 10 years and comes with a 5-year warranty.
EcoStruxure Ready APC Smart-UPS Ultra ensures better visibility anytime, anywhere
Being understaffed or lacking onsite staff makes management, maintenance and service activities such as inspecting equipment, replacing batteries, swapping out failed equipment very burdensome, particularly if assets are highly distributed and geographically dispersed. APC Smart-UPS Ultra is EcoStruxure™ Ready which allows cloud-based monitoring, delivers data-driven recommendations to optimise performance, and enables wherever-you-go visibility across multiple UPS devices. Connectivity is available via Ethernet Port or embedded network port, and the EcoStruxure Ready APC Smart-UPS web portal provides automated, customisable alerts regarding the health of the UPS to make preventative maintenance simpler in order to reduce downtime and lower mean time to repair.
The APC Smart-UPS Ultra is available in Europe. To learn more about the APC Smart-UPS Ultra, visit this web page.

ABOUT NICK JONAS:
After electrifying music from multiple angles, appearing in blockbuster films, and launching successful business ventures, Nick Jonas still challenges himself and popular culture. Of course, his story as one- third of Jonas Brothers remains well-documented—especially given the band's chart-dominating 2019 comeback Happiness Begins, sold out tours, and subsequent GRAMMY® Award nomination. At the same time, he established himself as a dynamic solo artist with a penchant for breaking boundaries. 2014's self-titled Nick Jonas yielded the triple-platinum "Jealous," double-platinum "Chains," and gold- certified "Levels." Its 2016 follow-up Last Year Was Complicated spawned the anthem "Close" [feat. Tove Lo] and brought his streams into the billions. In 2017, he contributed the Golden Globe® Award- nominated "Home" to the Ferdinand soundtrack. Meanwhile, his songwriting would be recognized with the prestigious Hal David Starlight Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2016. Along the way, he also captivated audiences as a re-occurring judge on NBC's The Voice and in big screen favorites such as Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, UglyDolls, Midway, Jumanji: The Next Level, Chaos Walking and more. In 2021, Nick released his studio album Spaceman [Island Records]. In 2022, Nick joined NBC's new competitive dance series Dancing With Myself as a judge alongside Shakira and Liza Koshy.

Ademi LLP alleges Luther Burbank's financial outlook and prospects are excellent and yet Luther Burbank holders will receive only 0.3353 shares of Washington Federal common stock for each share of Luther Burbank common stock they own. The transaction agreement unreasonably limits competing bids for Luther Burbank by imposing a significant penalty if Luther Burbank accepts a superior bid. Luther Burbank insiders will receive substantial benefits as part of change of control arrangements.
We are investigating the conduct of Luther Burbank's board of directors, and whether they are (i) fulfilling their fiduciary duties to all shareholders, and (ii) obtaining a fair and reasonable price for Luther Burbank.

Full text: BASEL, Switzerland, Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Nouscom, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing off-the-shelf and personalized immunotherapies, today announced the first patient has been dosed in a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating NOUS-209 in combination with anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab alone. NOUS-209 is an off-the-shelf immunotherapy targeting 209 specific neoantigens for the treatment of Mismatch Repair/Microsatellite Instable High (dMMR/MSI-H) unresectable or metastatic gastric, colorectal and gastro-esophageal junction tumors.
Nouscom is assessing the efficacy and safety of NOUS-209 in combination with pembrolizumab at multiple sites across Europe and the US (NCT04041310). The Phase 2 study will include two cohorts in dMMR/MSI-H unresectable and metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC):
- A randomized cohort enrolling patients who are eligible for first line treatment of NOUS-209 plus pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab alone;
- A single arm cohort enrolling patients who have stopped responding to previous anti-PD1 and other approved therapies
Dr Michael J. Overman, Principal Investigator of the trial and Professor in the Department of GastroIntestinal Medical Oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, said: " The continued clinical development of NOUS-209 is critical as there remains a significant unmet need in the treatment of CRC, including overcoming tumor resistance to anti-PD1 immunotherapies. Data from the Phase 1 study presented at ASCO 2022 1 and published in Science Translational Medicine 2   demonstrated how NOUS-209 induces neoantigen specific CD8+ T cells which infiltrate metastatic tumors and exert anti-tumor efficacy, providing hope for better treatment options for this patient population with difficult to treat cancers."
Dr Marina Udier, Chief Executive Officer of Nouscom, added: " The initiation of the Phase 2 study is another significant milestone this year for our company. Building on our published safety, immunogenicity and mechanism of action clinical data, the trial, together with the Phase 1 'cancer interception' monotherapy study in Lynch Syndrome carriers, will allow us to demonstrate the efficacy of NOUS-209 and illustrate the power of our platform. We look forward to presenting interim results at key conferences during 2023."

About NOUS-209
NOUS-209 is an off-the-shelf cancer immunotherapy for Microsatellite Instable High (MSI-H) tumors. MSI-H tumors are characterized by a defective DNA mismatch repair system, which generates highly immunogenic neoantigens called frame shift peptides (FSP) that are not present in healthy tissue.
NOUS-209 encodes for 209 shared FSP neoantigens, selected by Nouscom's proprietary GENESIS ( GE (netic) NE (oantigen) S (election) I (n) S (ilico)) algorithm. In published prospective validation studies, approximately 50 of the 209 neoantigens are expressed in any one patient's tumor. These FSPs are cloned into Nouscom's heterologous prime / boost viral vector platform of a Great Ape Adenoviral (GAd) and Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) and potently generate FSP neoantigen specific CD8+ T cells, which have been shown to successfully infiltrate tumor microenvironments to exert anti-tumor activity.
NOUS-209 is being investigated in multi-center EU and US Phase 2 randomized clinical trials in patients with dMMR/MSI-H unresectable and metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) (NCT04041310) in combination with checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) versus CPI alone and in patients who have stopped responding to previous anti-PD1 and other approved CPI therapies.

Key Findings
The report has the following key findings:
- SNS Telecom & IT estimates that annual investments in public safety LTE and 5G infrastructure will reach nearly $1.6 Billion by the end of 2022, driven by both new build-outs and the expansion of existing dedicated, hybrid government-commercial and secure MVNO/MOCN networks. Complemented by a rapidly expanding ecosystem of public safety-grade LTE/5G devices, the market will further grow at a CAGR of approximately 13% between 2022 and 2025, eventually accounting for more than $2.3 Billion by the end of 2025.
- In addition to the high-profile FirstNet, South Korea's Safe-Net and Britain's ESN nationwide public safety broadband projects, many additional national-level programs are making considerable headway in moving from field trials to wider scale deployments – most notably, France's RRF, Spain's SIRDEE mission-critical broadband network, Finland's VIRVE 2.0 broadband service, Sweden's Rakel G2 secure broadband system and Hungary's EDR 2.0/3.0 broadband network.
- Other operational and planned deployments include but are not limited to the Halton-Peel region PSBN in Canada's Ontario province, China's city and district-wide Band 45 (1.4 GHz) LTE networks for police forces, Royal Thai Police's Band 26 (800 MHz) LTE network, Qatar MOI (Ministry of Interior), ROP (Royal Oman Police) and Nedaa's mission-critical LTE networks in the oil-rich GCC region, Brazil's state-wide Band 28 (700 MHz) networks for both civil and military police agencies, Barbados' Band 14 (700 MHz) LTE-based connectivity service platform, and Zambia's 400 MHz broadband trunking system.
- Production-grade deployments of 3GPP standards-compliant MCX services – beginning with MCPTT – are continuing to accelerate over both commercial and public safety broadband networks. Early adopters range from Safe-Net, FirstNet and ESN to mobile operators such as Verizon, Southern Linc, Telus, SFR, KPN, Swisscom, Telia, Føroya Tele and STC (Saudi Telecom Company).
- Even though critical public safety-related 5G NR capabilities defined in the 3GPP's Release 17 specifications are yet to be commercialized, public safety agencies have already begun experimenting with 5G for applications that can benefit from the technology's high-bandwidth and low-latency characteristics. For example, the Lishui Municipal Emergency Management Bureau is using a 5G-enabled closed-loop system for integrated emergency visualization and natural disaster management.
- As 5G implementations become well-established in the 2020s, MCX services in high-density environments, real-time UHD video transmission through coordinated fleets of drones, 5G-connected autonomous police robots, smart ambulances, AR (Augmented Reality) firefighting helmets and other sophisticated public safety broadband applications will become a common sight.
- Over the last two years, COWs (Cells-on-Wheels), COLTs (Cells-on-Light Trucks) and other deployable LTE network assets have played a pivotal role in facilitating mission-critical communications, real-time transmission of video footage, and improved situational awareness for incident command and emergency response needs – for instance, the mobilization of FirstNet deployables during the wildfire seasons of 2021 and 2022 in the United States.
- 5G NR-equipped portable network systems are also beginning to emerge. For example, Taiwan's Hsinchu City Fire Department is using an emergency response vehicle – which features a satellite-backhauled private 5G network based on Open RAN standards – to establish high-bandwidth, low-latency emergency communications in disaster zones. Between 2022 and 2025, SNS Telecom & IT expects cumulative spending on deployable assets for public safety broadband to exceed $700 Million.
- Although much of the public safety spectrum debate is centered around low-band frequencies in the sub-1 GHz range, a number of PPDR stakeholders have started eyeing up mmWave spectrum reservation to be able to support advanced use cases in the coming years. For example, the Hungarian Ministry of Interior has specifically requested access to a 200 MHz block of Band n258 (26 GHz) spectrum for future 5G applications.
- In addition, first responder agencies in Germany, Japan and several other markets are beginning to utilize mid-band and mmWave spectrum available for local area licensing to deploy portable and small-scale 5G NPNs (Non-Public Networks) to support applications such as UHD video surveillance and control of unmanned firefighting vehicles, reconnaissance robots and drones.
- In the near future, we also expect to see rollouts of localized 5G NR systems for incident scene management and related use cases, potentially using up to 50 MHz of Band n79 spectrum in the 4.9 GHz frequency range (4,940-4,990 MHz), which has been designated for public safety use in multiple countries including but not limited to the United States, Canada, Australia, Malaysia and Qatar.
- The ProSe chipset ecosystem has failed to materialize in the LTE era due to limited support from chipmakers and terminal OEMs. However, the 5G NR sidelink interface offers a clean slate opportunity to introduce direct mode, D2D communications for public safety broadband users, as well as coverage expansion in both on-network and off-network scenarios using UE-to-network and UE-to-UE relays respectively.
- Another barrier impeding the market is the non-availability of cost-optimized COTS RAN equipment and terminals that support operation in certain frequency bands such as Band 68 (698-703 MHz / 753-758 MHz), which has been allocated for PPDR broadband systems in multiple European countries.

Full text: "Rudolf Dreikurs, M.D.-Adlerian Psychology: The Man and His Mission, Message and Ideas" from Christian Faith Publishing author William L. Camp, Ph.D., FACAPP is an intellectual exploration of Dreikurs life, research, and commitment to refining effective counseling techniques.
MEADVILLE, Pa., Nov. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- "Rudolf Dreikurs, M.D.-Adlerian Psychology: The Man and His Mission, Message and Ideas": an intimate and informative examination of Dr. Rudolf Dreikurs. "Rudolf Dreikurs, M.D.-Adlerian Psychology: The Man and His Mission, Message and Ideas" is the creation of published author William L. Camp, Ph.D., FACAPP, who earned his Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in 1968 and did additional postdoctoral study at the University of Chicago and Mendota Mental Health Institute in Madison, Wisconsin, and was licensed to practice psychology in 1970. He has been elected as a fellow of the American College of Advanced Practice Psychologists and the American Board of Medical Psychotherapists, among many other professional organizations.
Dr. Camp shares, "Rudolf Dreikurs, MD, was an Austrian – born American psychiatrist and educator, who lived from 1897 to 1972. He originally helped to develop the Austrian medical doctor Alfred Adler's ideas called individual psychology into a pragmatic method for understanding the purposes of inappropriate childhood behavior without punishment or reward. He worked with Dr. Adler both in Europe and in the United States and later organized and refined Dr. Adler's and his own ideas into an effective treatment system. These insights and treatment methods were then further refined by Dr. Dreikurs during the remainder of his life to become a highly usable theory of personality and psychological treatment, not only for use with children but also with families, counselors, teachers, and others, including groups.
"The content of this book summarizes the results of his commitment and mission in doing this work as he created, tested, refined, and applied these concepts in creation of methods for understanding and treatment of a wide variety of behavior problems and disorders common in families worldwide. He also trained people to use these methods in various countries throughout the world. In doing so, he adapted and applied his knowledge in work with business, industry and government, including the military.
"The ideas and methods contained in this volume are easily understood and may be applied immediately by parents and their families, by teachers in classrooms, and by others -- now, today -- with valuable positive results. The chapters in this book provide a distillation of logical techniques and procedures, for productive application of his original insights including those originated by Dr. Adler and others.
"Dr. Camp had the honor to meet Dr. Dreikurs in 1970, two years before his death. At that time Dr. Dreikurs told him and a few others that if he had their youth, he would write another book or books to further update and share his insights with new/upcoming generations. This volume is part of an attempt to do exactly that."
Published by Christian Faith Publishing, William L. Camp, Ph.D., FACAPP's new book is a welcome resource for students seeking a deeper understanding of Dreikurs life and work.
Consumers can purchase "Rudolf Dreikurs, M.D.-Adlerian Psychology: The Man and His Mission, Message and Ideas" at traditional brick & mortar bookstores, or online at Amazon.com, Apple iTunes store, or Barnes and Noble.

Full text: A new Master of Science in Imaging Sciences program at UT Health San Antonio will be unique as an entry-to-the-profession master's degree program that provides eligibility for three national certifications by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists. The planned degree program is under the auspices of the School of Health Professions at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio).
SAN ANTONIO, November 14, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ --The School of Health Professions at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio) plans to launch a new Master of Science in Imaging Sciences program to train imaging technologists in radiography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to address the technologist shortages currently stressing the health care system.
"The program will be the only one of its kind in the country — an entry-to-the-profession master's multi-modality program which provides eligibility for three national certifications by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists," said program director Laura P. Vasquez, PhD, MS, RVT, RT, MRSO.
"This will allow graduates to practice in all states," after obtaining the certifications, Vasquez said. Many area health care systems have numerous open technologist positions, she added.
The MS in Imaging Sciences application is open for the program's first cohort, which will begin in Fall 2023, pending full approval by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.
Meeting the need for imaging specialists
Training medical imaging technologists at UT Health San Antonio will help meet the need for imaging technologist specialists locally and improve patient care by enabling imaging studies to be completed more swiftly, said Professor Rajeev Suri, MD, MBA, FACR, FSIR, interim chair of the Department of Radiology in the Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long School of Medicine at UT Health San Antonio.
"There is a marked need for technologists with this training in the community," Suri said, explaining that COVID-19 further depleted the number of imaging technologists as the pandemic caused some to retire or resign. "Almost all places in town — private, VA, county — are struggling to recruit trained MRI, CT and X-ray technologists."
Versatile training
The program's curriculum is designed so that students must complete each modality phase and related certification to progress to the next phase. The first phase is radiography, followed by CT and finally, MRI. Students also will participate in clinical practicums with clinical affiliates in hospital and outpatient imaging settings. The master's curriculum also includes leadership, education and research courses, which prepare graduates for management, teaching and research roles. This program may be suited for individuals interested in medicine, as the ability to interpret radiography, CT and MRI is an essential skill for medical students and most pre-health preparatory programs lack comprehensive imaging education, Vasquez said.
Job prospects are particularly strong for imaging technologists who possess certifications in multiple modalities, Vasquez said, adding that the program's design will enable students to obtain eligibility to sit for three national certification exams in two years — just one-third of the time typically required to earn all three certifications when taken separately. After completing the program, graduates will be eligible for state licensure by the Department of State Health Services to the Texas Medical Board.
A career as a medical imaging technologist can appeal to individuals who desire to work both with diagnostic technological applications and in direct patient care, said Vasquez. Medical imaging technologists "have to know the anatomy and physiology of the body, pathophysiology and pharmacology," Vasquez said. "There is a lot of science behind it, but you must also be compassionate and want to work in patient care. Our patients, veterans and community deserve excellence in patient care."
To learn more about the program's admission requirements, curriculum and clinical experiences, visit the MS in Imaging Sciences program page. Matriculation into the program is contingent upon SACSCOC approval.
The Master of Science in Imaging Sciences program was approved by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board on June 29, 2022, with an implementation date of August 2023. Under the auspices of the School of Health Professions, the MS in Imaging Sciences is pending approval by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC).
The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio(UT Health San Antonio), a primary driver for San Antonio's $42.4 billion health care and biosciences sector, is the largest research university in South Texas with an annual research portfolio of $350 million. Driving substantial economic impact with its five professional schools, a diverse workforce of more than 7,000, an annual operating budget of more than $1 billion and a clinical practice that provides more than 2 million patient visits each year, UT Health San Antonio plans to add more than 1,500 higher-wage jobs over the next five years to serve San Antonio, Bexar County and South Texas.

Full text: PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- HLG is a leading manufacturer of LED horticultural lighting. The company pioneered high efficiency crop lighting with its Quantum Board® technology and has grown to one of the leading suppliers of horticulture lighting. GrowFlux Mesh is a wireless control technology developed for the horticultural lighting industry. It uniquely combines the convenience of cloud connected devices with the reliability of conventional wired control systems.
"With our partnership with HLG, commercial growers will have the latest precision control technology integrated directly into the lights. This allows businesses to scale faster, save energy, and cut capital costs.", says GrowFlux CEO Eric Eisele. Connected lighting from HLG takes only minutes to set up out of the box with the GrowFlux App and scales to farms of any size with GrowFlux Mesh.
The tremendous amount of energy that goes into lighting crops in indoor farms and greenhouses represents a rapidly evolving crop input. Therefore, energy saving lighting controls are an increasingly critical solution in the controlled environment agriculture industry in light of soaring energy prices.
"Validating GrowFlux mesh against other wireless control technologies gave us the confidence to offer wireless controls to our customers while maintaining the quality and reliability HLG is known for. Many of our customers have high value crops under our lights and competing wireless control technologies couldn't give growers certainty that their crops wouldn't experience disruption." said HLG CEO Steve Johnson.
GrowFlux's platform includes easy to use apps for any device, including iOS, Android, and a web browser-based control panel. In addition, the platform enables next generation autonomous control systems with cloud enabled software APIs that enterprise growers and control system developers can leverage.

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pomerantz LLP is investigating claims on behalf of investors of  Honda Motor Co., Ltd. ("Honda" or the "Company") (NYSE: HMC).  Such investors are advised to contact Robert S. Willoughby at  newaction@pomlaw.com or 888-476-6529, ext. 7980.
The investigation concerns whether Honda and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. 
[Click here for information about joining the class action]  
On September 28, 2022, a putative class action was filed against Honda alleging that the Company sold thousands of vehicles that contain a critical safety flaw putting drivers and others at serious risk of injury.  Specifically, the lawsuit against Honda alleges that a wide range of Honda vehicles share a flawed "auto start/stop" function (also called "Idle Stop") intended to save fuel by shutting the engine down at stops, and that the Idle Stop system in these vehicles routinely fails to restart the engine as designed, leaving drivers unable to move their vehicles.  The lawsuit further alleges that Honda was fully aware of the defect before marketing the vehicles. 
On this news, Honda's American Depositary Receipt ("ADR") price fell $0.74 per ADR, or 3.23%, to close at $22.19 per ADR on September 29, 2022.
Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 85 years later, Pomerantz continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomlaw.com.

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pomerantz LLP is investigating claims on behalf of investors of PayPal Holdings, Inc. ("PayPal" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: PYPL). Such investors are advised to contact Robert S. Willoughby at newaction@pomlaw.com or 888-476-6529, ext. 7980.
The investigation concerns whether PayPal and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. 
[Click here for information about joining the class action]  
On February 1, 2022, PayPal reported disappointing fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. Specifically, PayPal reported that its Net New Active Accounts were only 49 million for 2021, less than the guidance of 50 million it initially provided in February 2021. The Company admitted that "in connection with the increased use of cash incentive campaigns throughout 2021, [it] identified 4.5 million accounts that "it" believes(s) were illegitimately created," and that as a result the Company changed course on some of its customer acquisition strategies including incentive-led campaigns in the fourth quarter. Further, because the Company was evolving its customer acquisition and engagement strategy, PayPal now expects only 15-20 million net new customer accounts for 2022 and that the Company "no longer believe(s) that the 750 million medium-term account aspiration [it] set last year, is appropriate." 
On this news, PayPal's stock price fell $43.23 per share, or 24.59%, to close at $132.57 per share on February 2, 2022.

Full text: PITTSBURGH, Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- "I thought there should be a simple and mess-free way to access to the contents at the bottom of a peanut butter or other food container," said an inventor, from Berwyn, Ill., "so I invented the TOTAL ACCESS.

As a result, it reduces hassles, messes and waste and it saves time and effort. The invention features an adjustable and practical design that is easy to use so it is ideal for households. Additionally, it is producible in design variations.
The original design was submitted to the Chicago sales office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pomerantz LLP is investigating claims on behalf of investors of Seagate Technology Holdings plc ("Seagate" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: STX).  Such investors are advised to contact Robert S. Willoughby at  newaction@pomlaw.com or 888-476-6529, ext. 7980.
The investigation concerns whether Seagate and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. 
[Click here for information about joining the class action]  
On October 26, 2022, Seagate announced its financial results for its fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2022.  Minutes later, Seagate disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") that the Company had been warned by the U.S. government of its potential violation of export control laws by selling hard disk drives to a customer on a trade blacklist between August 2020 and September 2021, which is believed to be China's Huwei.  Huwei is on the U.S. Commerce Department's entity list and banned from buying U.S. exports and certain foreign-made items without government approval.  Seagate received a "proposed charging letter" from the U.S. Commerce Department on August 29, 2022.  Seagate's position is that the hard disk drives are not subject to the U.S. export regulations, and it did not engage in prohibited conduct.  Seagate had previously paused shipments to Huwei a year earlier. 
Following the disclosures in the Company's SEC filing, Seagate's ordinary share price fell $4.61 per share, or 7.95%, to close at $53.39 per share on October 26, 2022.
Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions.

Full text: MIAMI, Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Miami really is the city that has it all: beautiful beaches, amazing food, legendary nightlife, and stunning views, which makes it the perfect driving destination for supercar owners. That's why Southern California's premier exotic supercar club is opening Fast Lane Drive-Miami in early 2023.
"Miami is home to one of the highest concentrations of exotic car owners and we are so excited to announce the launch of Fastlane Drive Miami. This social club is the ultimate environment for automotive enthusiasts and collectors to network, share their passion, and enjoy exclusive drives and events that only Fastlane Drive curates."
- Ryan McFarland, Fast Lane Drive-Miami
So, what is Fast Lane Drive? It's the freshest take on the exotic car club that goes beyond just the rally (although rallies are still at the heart of the club). Fast Lane has crafted the perfect formula for all car lovers who love and appreciate the craftsmanship and sheer power of their supercars. Events span over the full calendar year, varying between local rallies, special events including yacht parties and charity galas, and of course weekend events, where members meet at exclusive destinations for an all-inclusive driving experience (vehicle shipping included). The thing that makes Fast Lane so unique—and the reason each chapter has a capped membership—is its ability to bring together like-minded individuals whose love of driving should be shared.
Fast Lane Drive started in San Diego, CA with just a core group of friends, and has since expanded to Los Angeles, Scottsdale, and Las Vegas with chapters on the horizon in San Francisco and even Monaco. Each chapter is unique, bringing its own city's culture to the table. And what better place to enjoy luxury than Miami? That's why Ryan McFarland, Eddie Piazza, and Colby Watkins reached out to open their own chapter in the Sunshine State.
But Clement Connor, the CEO & founder of Fast Lane Drive also recognizes that in bringing people together with the means to enjoy the luxury lifestyle, they are also presented with a special opportunity and an even greater responsibility. That responsibility is to give back to the communities that have provided the members with so much. Each Fast Lane Drive chapter is dedicated to philanthropy, some local and some national, but all the while giving back to a community that actually makes a difference. Miami is a very special place that's rich in culture and rich in opportunity, and Fast Lane Drive hopes to tap into that community to give back to local causes. Members are encouraged to represent causes that are close to their own hearts, and the part of membership means the highest level of support from the club.
Perhaps the most important aspect of Fast Lane Drive that sets it apart from other car clubs is the value of friendship. Fast Lane's arduous application process is meant to carefully select like-minded individuals who, though strangers at first, often grow into lifelong friends. It's as simple as bringing together friends who have a love for driving—not just watching their supercars collect dust. That's really the foundation of Fast Lane Drive: friendship and appreciation. We can't wait to see its impact on the community of Miami, and we're even more eager to see that iconic Fast Lane line of supercars driving through South Beach like a row of candy.
If you're interested in becoming a member of Fast Lane Drive Miami, sign up for the newsletter at fastlanedrive.com/miami and be the first to know about Miami's application process and launch date.

In respect of any Notes accepted for purchase, the Issuer will also pay an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid interest on the relevant Notes from (and including) the interest payment date for such Notes immediately preceding the Settlement Date to (but excluding) the Settlement Date (such amount in respect of a Series, the " Accrued Interest Payment ").
The Issuer reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, not to accept any Tender Instructions, not to purchase Notes or to extend, re-open, withdraw or terminate the Offers and to amend or waive any of the terms and conditions of the Offers in any manner, subject to applicable laws and regulations.
Tenders of Notes for purchase must be made to the Issuer in accordance with the procedures set out in the Tender Offer Memorandum. The Issuer intends to announce, inter alia , its decision of whether to accept valid tenders of Notes for purchase pursuant to the Offers in an announcement expected to be made on 15 November 2022.
THE OFFERS WILL EXPIRE AT 5:00 P.M. (NEW YORK CITY TIME) ON 14 NOVEMBER 2022 (THE "EXPIRATION DEADLINE") UNLESS EXTENDED, RE-OPENED, WITHDRAWN OR TERMINATED AT THE SOLE DISCRETION OF THE ISSUER.

The Settlement Date is expected to be 17 November 2022 (subject to the right of the Issuer to extend, re-open, amend and/or terminate any Offer).
The Issuer reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to extend, re-open, withdraw or terminate the Offers and to amend or waive any of the terms and conditions of the Offers at any time, as described in the Tender Offer Memorandum under the heading " Amendment and Termination ". Details of any such extension, re-opening, withdrawal, termination, amendment or waiver will be notified to the Noteholders as soon as possible after such decision.

I thought there could be a better way to clean the ostomy pouch," said an inventor, from Lancaster, S.C., "so I invented the CLEANING DAB. My design would offer a more thorough and sanitary method of removing waste matter from the pouch."

Full text: PITTSBURGH, Nov. 14, 2022 "We wanted to provide softball and baseball players with an effective training aid to help improve hitting skills," said one of two inventors, from Shelly, N.C., "so we invented the ULTIMATE HITTER.

The patent-pending invention provides an innovative and versatile new batting tee for baseball players. In doing so, it trains a batter to see the ball at various locations relative to home plate and the batter's box. As a result, it helps batters improve hitting technique and skill and it eliminates the need for another person to pitch practice balls. The invention features an effective design that is easy to use so it is ideal for baseball and softball players, teams, coaches, etc. Additionally, it is producible in design variations.

Full text: Arasan announces the immediate availability of its MIPI CSI IP supporting C-PHY v2.0 speeds of up to 54.72Gbps (when operating up to 8 Gsps with all 3 channels) for FPGA designs
SAN JOSE, Calif., Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Arasan has released an all new version of its MIPI CSI IP compliant with the CSI-2 v2.1 Specifications supporting C-PHY v2.0 speeds of up to 8 Gbps (for 1channel) for FPGA designs. This IP is designed to meet FPGA timing limitations to run at slower frequencies while still providing the necessary bandwidth.
In confirming with our tagline "We are Compliance", Arasan's IP has been used on multiple protocol analyzers, lab based standards compliance testers and high volume production testers. The new MIPI CSI-2 IP is primarily targeted towards such compliance and production test applications. 
Arasan MIPI D-PHY IP, C-PHY, CSI IP and DSI IP are already used for compliance testing for speeds of up to 2.5Gsps. This new CSI-2 controller for FPGA works seamlessly with Arasan's MIPI C/D-PHY Combo ASIC supporting speeds of upto 4.5Gsps. Compliance test companies can license our controller and MIPI C-PHY / D-PHY Combo ASIC to build their products.
Imaging companies that would like to build prototypes or limited production quantities of their high resolution camera products can also license our CSI IP along with the MIPI C-PHY / D-PHY Combo ASIC.
The MIPI CSI IP for FPGA is available for immediate licensing. Customers licensing our CSI Controller IP can have the peace of mind knowing our IP is compliant with the specifications. It is used to test Compliance!

Full text: MILWAUKEE, Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Ademi LLP is investigating Opiant (NASDAQ: OPNT) for possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law in its transaction with Indivior. 
Click here to learn how to join the action https://www.ademilaw.com/case/opiant-pharmaceuticals-inc or call Guri Ademi toll-free at 866-264-3995.  There is no cost or obligation to you.
Ademi LLP alleges Opiant's financial outlook and prospects are excellent and yet Opiant holders will receive only $20.00 per share in cash at closing, plus contingent value rights (CVRs) representing, if achieved, potential additional payments over a period of seven years of up to $8.00 per share. Pursuant to the CVRs, Indivior will pay $2.00 per CVR if OPNT003 achieves the following net revenue thresholds during any period of four consecutive quarters prior to the seventh anniversary of the U.S. commercial launch: (i) $225 million, (ii) $300 million, and (iii) $325 million. The remaining $2.00 per CVR will become payable if OPNT003 achieves net revenue of $250 million during any period of four consecutive quarters prior to the third anniversary of the U.S. commercial launch. Opiant notes that there can be no guarantee that the CVR payments will be achieved as the future performance of OPNT003 is subject to several risks and uncertainties. The transaction agreement unreasonably limits competing bids for Opiant by imposing a significant penalty if Opiant accepts a superior bid. Opiant insiders will receive substantial benefits as part of change of control arrangements.
We are investigating the conduct of Opiant's board of directors, and whether they are (i) fulfilling their fiduciary duties to all shareholders, and (ii) obtaining a fair and reasonable price for Opiant.
If you own Opiant common stock and wish to obtain additional information, please contact Guri Ademi either at gademi@ademilaw.com or toll-free: 866-264-3995, or https://www.ademilaw.com/case/opiant-pharmaceuticals-inc.

Decision by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services lowers barriers to healthcare access for individuals with Medicare
CENTER VALLEY, Pa., Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Olympus, a global technology leader in designing and delivering innovative solutions for medical and surgical procedures, today applauded the decision by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to eliminate cost sharing for Medicare beneficiaries who have a colonoscopy in follow-up to a positive at-home colorectal cancer test. Prior to this policy change by CMS, patients whose at-home screen resulted in concerning results were faced with co-pay costs associated with follow-up colonoscopy; these costs are now eliminated for the covered patient. Olympus also supports the decision for Medicare to cover colonoscopies beginning at age 45, which is in line with the new age recommendation from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). 1
"These rule changes represent a significant step toward improving colorectal cancer care and expanding access to preventive screenings," said Paul Skodny, executive director, Global Health Economics & Market Access at Olympus Corporation of America. "The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) considers colonoscopy the gold standard for screening 2 , but the procedure may not be readily available to everyone. That's why it's so important to support colon cancer screening and detection by eliminating cost sharing, such as co-pays, when an at-home test reveals the need for a follow-up colonoscopy."
A colonoscopy can help prevent colorectal cancer (CRC) by finding and removing polyps that can develop into cancer. 3
CMS is expanding the regulatory definition of colorectal cancer screening tests to include a complete colorectal cancer screening in which a follow-on screening colonoscopy after a Medicare covered non-invasive stool-based colorectal cancer screening test returns a positive result.
The USPSTF last year lowered the recommended screening age for those at average risk for colorectal cancer from 50 to 45. The CMS rule change brings Medicare coverage in line with USPSTF recommendations and makes coverage consistent with Medicaid and most private coverage.
The American Cancer Society estimates that more than 150,000 cases of CRC will be diagnosed in 2022 accompanied by more than 52,500 deaths. The CRC death rate has steadily declined from 29 per 100,000 cases in 1970 to just under 13 per 100,000 cases in 2019, a roughly 56% drop. The American Cancer Society attributes that trend primarily to earlier detection through screening and improvements in treatment. 4
While incidence of CRC in adults ages 50 and older decreased by about 2% annually between 2014 and 2018, they increased by 1.5% per year in younger people, according to the American Cancer Society. When caught in its earliest stages, colorectal cancer has a roughly 90% five-year survival rate. 4
"Given the trend of increased incidence of colorectal cancer among a younger patient population, it's more important than ever to make sure cost doesn't serve as a disincentive for preventive screening," says Taichi Nakamura, , M.D., Ph.D., Olympus Corp., Medical Scientific Affairs, GI/ET Global Medical Lead. "Data already shows that about half of eligible adults ages 50 to 54 are not up to date with CRC screening. 5 Olympus remains committed to improving patient outcomes by raising awareness around colorectal cancer, as well as the benefits of preventive screenings generally."
The New England Journal of Medicine recently published study results from the Northern-European Initiative on Colorectal Cancer (NordICC) trial. 6 The accompanying media coverage suggested that the benefits of colonoscopies may have been overestimated. However, physicians reacting to the media coverage pointed out that the study results were misinterpreted.
The study included 84,585 men and women from Norway, Sweden, Poland and the Netherlands between the ages of 55-64. But of the roughly 28,000 people invited to undergo a screening colonoscopy, only about 42% had one. The study found that those who had a colonoscopy saw a reduction in CRC incidence and death by 31% and 50%, respectively. Olympus supports the positions of gastroenterology societies and stands behind the conclusion of the ASGE that having a colonoscopy performed according to clinical guidelines remains the recommended screening method for CRC.

MILAN, Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The value of diverse talent is at the core of S.Pellegrino Young Chef Academy , the inspiring community created by S.Pellegrino to nurture the next generation of visionary chefs. In line with this, the leading sparkling mineral water brand presents 'Driving gender balance in kitchens' , a digital forum to raise awareness on the gender balance issue within the food sector .

Where are we today in terms of female representation across the industry? What are the roots of its gender disparity? Why is change needed? How do we create inclusive environments at restaurants? Across four episodes  - available on the S.Pellegrino Young Chef Academy website - the webinar series explores different aspects of the gender disbalance issue whilst outlining a roadmap for change.
Alongside  Tom Jenkins , journalist and S.Pellegrino Young Chef Academy spokesperson, as the moderator, the protagonists of the discussion about how to create a fairer and more representative sector are: Maria Canabal , award-winning journalist and Founder and President of the Parabere Forum, Vicky Lau, chef-patron of the two-Michelin starred Tate Dining Room and Mora in Hong Kong, Cristina Bowerman, the only female chef in Rome to not only helm a Michelin-starred restaurant, at Glass Hostaria, but to hold three forks from Gambero Rosso, and Nicolai Nørregaard , the chef and co-owner of the Michelin-starred Kadeau restaurants in Bornholm and Copenhagen, Denmark.
THE WEBINAR SERIES MAIN TAKEOUTS
-  K i tchens as boys' clubs
Canabal, starting from the history of modern cuisine, highlights how, over the years, the militarised kitchen brigade system that favours men and everyday sexist attitudes, have held female chefs back. Female chefs are often underrepresented and unrecognised.
And the renowned chefs confirmed this: "If you go through the list of award-winning women in the world, they are almost all restaurant owners. For us, being independent is the only way to change this system", says Lau, "and despite having no experience, when I started alone, I didn't want to recreate an aggressive military regime. I have chosen and continue to choose calm, serene, balanced people," she concludes.
Nørregaard has decided to manage his kitchen differently, with no tolerance for aggression, screams and tension. "I am always the one who takes the final decision, but I learned, from a male chef, to be kind and respectful," adds Bowerman.
-  The female chef representation issue in food media, juries and at events 
Search online for 'famous chefs' and the images that appear are always of men. But the first chef to be awarded three Michelin stars twice was a woman, Eugènie Brazier, and it was back in 1933.
"This is proof that women in high-level kitchens aren't a recent phenomenon," Canabal underlines "but today they are paid 28% less than their male colleagues. And if 93% of domestic cooking is the prerogative of women, if 48% of undergraduates in cooking schools are women, but especially if 55% of the world population is women, is there still a real need to distinguish between male chefs and female chefs? Talent has no gender: are we wired to identify talent when it comes in a feminine shape, or are we much more wired to identify the talent when it comes in a masculine shape?" she says.
"I often feel that I am interviewed as a woman," says Lau, "I am asked to give my point of view as a female chef and female owner, as if there were differences with men and as if my specific job, my path did not matter in itself."  Bowerman also shares her experience of unequal pay: "I feel that I am a second choice for many events. Those who organise festivals, events, forums are looking for a woman not for her talent or for her path, but only as a woman, treating us as interchangeable." In addition, Bowerman continues, "women are offered about 20% less than men and the offer decreases every time we move to the second name on the list."
As proof of this, female guests at events are present in decidedly negligible percentages, except for the world jury of the S.Pellegrino Young Chef Academy Competition where 57% of the jurors are women.
-  Improving work-life balance is a common objective
Lau, Bowerman and Nørregaard agree that stereotypes in the kitchen must be removed.
Working in the hospitality sector is challenging for all genders and everyone feels the need to find solutions that allow flexibility for the brigade, improving the balance between private life and work.
Tom Jenkins  commented: "We recognise that gastronomy can be a challenging industry for female chefs and that they are often under-represented within it. For this reason, we are particularly proud of the webinar series project, one of the Academy's educational activities to bring the gender balance issue to the centre of the debate, disseminating good equality practices and inspiring young female chefs in their professional development."

Floating Storage Regasification Unit (FSRU) Market 2022-2026: Driver and Challenge
The cost competitiveness of FSRUs is driving the global floating storage regasification unit (FSRU) market growth. An FSRU is a floating LNG facility that can be deployed easily for end-to-end transportation. It uses a hybrid shipping vessel for the transportation of LNG. These ships offer a solution to the shortage of fuel, which drives their rate of adoption. These competitive advantages as well as the global measures toward increasing the adoption of clean fuels are expected to drive the growth of the FSRU market during the forecast period.
The growth in a number of alternatives for natural gas transportation is challenging the global floating storage regasification unit (FSRU) market growth. The transportation of LNG includes the use of vessels such as FSRUs, floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels, and floating storage and offloading (FSO) units. An FPSO unit contains a hydrocarbon storage system underneath the deck. The advantages of FPSO units include less investment, rapid development of the fleet, easy relocation to other fields, and low cost of abandonment. These alternatives are used mainly for offshore gas storage and transportation. Hence, the high rate of adoption of FSO and FPSO will impede the growth of the market during the forecast period.

Full text: Introduces Cyber Hygiene Assessment and 3 rd Party Risk Management Playbook
FRISCO, Texas, and LAS VEGAS, Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- HITRUST is announcing resources that address national cyber and information security priorities identified by government agencies, legislators, and industry. First, the need for an effective set of cyber hygiene controls and mitigations (applicable to smaller organizations) that remain relevant to evolving cyber threats, and a reliable method to demonstrate that organizations have appropriately implemented those controls. Additionally, a standardized, effective, and practical methodology for organizations to determine the inherent risk posed by third parties and recommend an appropriate level of assurances to enable effective evaluation of the controls in operation by the third party – establishing a level of due care for third-party risk management.
"Having a cyber hygiene assessment that is kept relevant is a huge win in reducing breaches" "HITRUST's Innovation and Research teams were tasked with designing practical and effective solutions to solve these national cyber and information risk priorities," said Robert Booker, Chief Strategy Officer, HITRUST. "I am proud of what was developed as it addresses these crucial issues and will have a significant impact on reducing information risk across companies of all sizes, among those with different inherent risk characteristics, and across their community of suppliers and other associates." 
New Cyber Essentials Assessment This cyber essentials assessment was designed to meet several unique requirements. It had to:
- Provide a readiness (self) assessment or validated assessment with certification.
- Incorporate controls necessary for relevant and essential information and cyber security, including controls and mitigations associated with current and emerging cyber threats.
- Maintain control relevance as the cyber threat landscape evolves and, if warranted, electronically notify assessed entities of potentially relevant changes in control guidance and mitigations, enabling them to evaluate the current effectiveness of a specific control implementation.
- Incorporate an assurance program that ensures rely-ability of the results, while not being burdensome on the assessed entity to complete.
- Enable the results to be distributed in an electronically consumable manner instead of distributing as a PDF report.

To achieve these unique design requirements, the new Cyber Essentials Assessment leverages HITRUST's (recently announced) Cyber Threat Adaptive approach to framework development and control selection, which ensures ongoing relevance of controls as the threat landscape evolves by frequently evaluating current Indicators of Attack (IoA) and Compromise (IoC) against security controls and mitigations associated with a cyber hygiene and essential level of assurance. 
This third assessment in the HITRUST Assessment portfolio allows HITRUST to offer assessment coverage across a broad spectrum of assurance needs. It targets lower-risk organizations as defined in the new HITRUST TPRM methodology or can be a starting point for organizations that may be early in implementing their information security controls. The Cyber Essentials Assessment will be available in January 2023.
"There is no question that available assessments being used to evaluate basic cyber hygiene, be it questionnaire or proprietary assessments, are lacking in control selection and relevance," said Omar Khawaja, vice president and chief information security officer (CISO) for Highmark Health. "Having a cyber hygiene assessment, that is kept relevant, with a commensurate level of effort to complete and incorporates HITRUST quality and consistency is a huge win in reducing breaches."
Quick-Start Guide to HITRUST TPRM Implementation Third-party risk management (TPRM), for those who rely on assurances and/or those who must provide them, can be made more efficient and effective through a standardized approach to triaging third parties based on specific inherent risk factors and selecting an assessment that provides a level of assurance appropriate to the risk they pose.
This Quick-Start Guide is designed to help organizations implement the information security-related components of a comprehensive third-party risk management program. It is designed to:
- Simplify and streamline usage of the recently updated HITRUST TPRM Methodology.
- Distill the broader methodology and its related formulas to a clear set of actionable steps.
- Provide clear guidance and recommendations on how to compute inherent risk, classify vendors, select the appropriate level of third-party assurance.
- Summarize alternative approaches to satisfy requirements while allowing organizations to understand and specify risk levels and tolerances.
- Provide links to additional reference material for further education on the concepts covered.

The Quick-Start Guide and TPRM Methodology incorporate the recently released (patent pending) HITRUST Assurance Rely-ability Maturity Model (ARMM), which is a unique methodology that objectively scores the rely-ability of an assurance method based on its specific features and pairs an appropriate assurance method for a third party based on its inherent risk to the relying party (via the inherent risk score computed during triage).
"It is key that organizations understand the inherent risk vendors pose and are able to obtain a reliable evaluation of the information risk in a way that is efficient for the third party," said Brenda Callaway, divisional vice president, Information Security Risk Management, HCSC . "HITRUST's new TPRM methodology and additional assessment options provide the important tools to better manage third-party risk."
Results Distribution System (RDS) Enhancements HITRUST is announcing enhancements to its Results Distribution System to streamline integration with TPRM solutions.
New API enhancements in the HITRUST Results Distribution System will make it easier for relying parties to integrate RDS into their TPRM solution. By leveraging RDS API, organizations can receive HITRUST assessment results electronically, whereby reducing the time and effort of tracking down, and inputting results into their TPRM solutions. In most cases today, organizations are manually only entering key result information into their TPRM solutions, which doesn't allow for vendor-specific or population analysis. RDS enables detailed assessment results to be captured and used for vendor and vendor population analysis and automates the receipt of updated assessment information, such as corrected action plans.
"As a leader in managed TPRM services, we understand the challenges organizations face and limitations that exist today in managing third-party risk," said Cliff Baker, CEO, CORL Technologies. "Having a comprehensive risk triage approach that can be widely adopted, and a low, medium, and high assessment portfolio , all capable of delivering results electronically into our managed TPRM solution , will enable more efficient and effective third-party risk management for our customers and the industry."
The Quick-Start Guide to HITRUST TPRM Implementation is available here: TPRM Playbook

Full text: Agent CRM announces the addition of "AdBase", a new tool that allows their users to launch Facebook Ads from within the desktop application. Alex Branning, the President of the Branning Group, said, "Today is a historic day for the Agent CRM brand! We continue to innovate, and improve the overall experience for our users."
NEW YORK, Nov. 14, 2022  /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Agent CRM announces the addition of "AdBase", a new tool that allows their users to launch Facebook Ads from within the desktop application.
Alex Branning said, "Today is a historic day for the Agent CRM brand! We continue to innovate, and improve the overall experience for our users. "
In an over-the-shoulder demonstration of the new tool LaMaya Laurez showed us how a new user can launch an ad from their template library in under one minute. LaMaya exclaimed, "Our competition doesn't have a tool that comes close to this, this is on another level."
AdBase was built to solve two problems: the length of time and technical expertise required to launch Facebook Ads, and the difficulty in overcoming the hurdles that Meta's advertising manager has been putting in front of new advertisers. In the demonstration of the tool, Ms. Laurez showed a user that Meta had restricted their ads account because their identity wasn't verified (and helpfully provided the link to submit their identification to resolve the issue), and the user pointed out that in the Meta Facebook Advertising Manager it simply notified them that their account was restricted without giving them the steps to resolve the issue.
Kari Chilson posted a review about Agent CRM and said, "[They have] an amazing support staff, I'm super grateful! They were patient with me while I learned Agent CRM and now I am running a fully automated business."
The AdBase tool currently includes ten different ad template folders with pre-built marketing campaigns for life insurance, annuities, home insurance and the Branning Group's "Giveaway Funnel." The Branning Group plans to release new template folders once a month These new template folders will be added by their own creative team, and through the acquisition of other digital marketing agencies.
Christy Drainer said, ""This is by far the best and simple CRM. The support is exceptional."
Alex Branning said, "AdBase eliminates the need for our users to go through training courses that teach how to run ads on the Meta platform. This tool simplifies the launching process, cleans up the 'Meta Maze' for overcoming vague error messages, and gives our users to proven ad campaigns."
The Agent CRM team shared that the future of AdBase includes integration with TikTok's advertising platform, regular live workshops for subscribers, and video ad templates.

Full text: Emory Students are the First to Train on the World's Most Advanced Interdisciplinary Patient Simulator, HAL® S5301
MIAMI and DECATUR, Ga., Oct. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Gaumard Scientific Co., an industry leader in simulation technology for healthcare education and training, announced that HAL ® S5301, the world's most advanced interdisciplinary patient simulator, has been installed at the Emory University Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing's new state-of-the-art simulation and learning center. This is the first commercial installation of HAL S5301, which has begun shipping to customers in the U.S.
HAL S5301 introduces several groundbreaking features including Conversational Speech enhanced by artificial intelligence * , lifelike motor movement and next-generation simulated physiology that allows HAL to simulate stroke symptoms and other medical conditions. Thus, educators can facilitate true-to-life clinical training experiences in the areas of emergency, trauma, ICU, and med-surg care with a level of fidelity never before possible.
HAL S5301's capabilities allow students to immerse themselves in realistic training scenarios that hone critical thinking skills and reinforce the transfer of these learned experiences to real-world clinical practice.
HAL S5301 is a permanent resident at the School of Nursing's Emory Nursing Learning Center, which opened to students this fall. The state-of-the-art facility has over 70,000 square feet of teaching and learning space with the capacity for deliberate practice, structured learning, feedback and debriefing, and high-stakes assessment exams. The center also offers immersive learning opportunities for licensed nurses through the Emory Nursing Experience, a partnership with Emory Healthcare. The Emory University Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing's Bachelor of Science (BSN) and Master's programs rank No. 2 in the nation, according to U.S. News & World Report.
"We are thrilled to announce the first installation of HAL S5301 at the Emory University Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing. HAL S5301's breakthrough speech enhanced by AI * and its clinical capabilities surpass those of any other patient simulators on the market. HAL represents the new generation of technology that will be used to educate and empower tomorrow's nursing and medical graduates with an unprecedented level of real-world skill, confidence, and preparation," noted John Eggert, Gaumard's Executive Vice President.
James Archetto, Gaumard's Vice President of U.S. Direct Sales, added, "This first installation of HAL S5301 highlights the importance of educating nursing students on high-risk, low-frequency clinical conditions using advanced technology and sophisticated training scenarios. Emory's faculty have already begun incorporating HAL S5301 into their curriculum to provide students with the most effective learning opportunities."
The School of Nursing's HAL S5301 – known as "Emory HAL" – is already having an impact.
"Because of Emory HAL's engineering and artificial intelligence capabilities, he can process information and respond to learners much more organically during simulations," said Mena Khan, MD, CHSE, Director of Operations for the Emory School of Nursing Simulation Program. "Emory HAL instills a more dynamic and interactive layer of preparation for our learners, much like actual patients. Our students will be even better prepared for nursing care and leadership roles because of their work with Emory HAL."

The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.
You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund's Distribution Policy.
Future earnings of the Fund cannot be guaranteed, and the Fund's distribution policy is subject to change. For more information on the Fund, please visit the Fund's website here.
The Fund's monthly distribution is set by its Board of Trustees. The Board reviews the Fund's distribution on a quarterly basis in view of its net investment income, realized and unrealized gains, and other net unrealized appreciation or income expected during the remainder of the year. The Fund strives to establish a level monthly distribution that, over the course of the year, will serve to distribute an amount closely approximating the Fund's net investment income and net realized capital gains during the year.
The following table sets forth the estimated sources of income of the current distribution, and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year to date from the following sources: net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains and return of capital or other capital source. All amounts are expressed on a per share of common stock basis and as a percentage of the distribution amount.

The Cumulative Total Return: -18.09%
There is no assurance the Fund will continue to pay regular monthly distributions or that it will do so at a particular rate.
You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of its distribution to shareholders. 
Any distributions in excess of the Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated first, as a tax-deferred return of capital, which is applied against and will reduce the adjusted tax basis of shares and, after such adjusted basis is reduced to zero, will generally constitute capital gains. A return of capital distribution may lower a shareholder's basis in the Fund, causing a potential future tax consequence in connection with the sale of Fund shares, even if such shares are sold at a loss to the shareholder's initial investments.
Any amounts and sources of distributions are only estimated and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of income of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend on the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will advise how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.
Before considering an investment in the Fund, you should understand that you could lose money. There are risks inherent in all investments. The Fund's risks include:
New Fund Risk : The Fund is a new fund which may result in additional risk. The Fund may cease operations and in such an event, investors may be required to liquidate or transfer their investments at an inopportune time. 
Limited Operating History Risk:  The Fund is a recently organized, non-diversified, closed end management investment company with limited operating history. It is designed for long term investing and not as a vehicle for trading. Shares of closed end investment companies frequently trade at a discount from their NAV.
Limited Term Risk:  Unless action is otherwise taken by the Board in accordance with the Declaration of Trust, the Fund will commence the process of liquidation and dissolution at the close of business on December 15, 2033 (the "Termination Date"). The Fund will not seek to return an initial investment in common shares by an investor on the Termination Date. Instead, the Fund will distribute an amount equal to the Fund's NAV at that time, which may be greater or less than an investor's initial investment.
Infrastructure Industry Risk : The Fund is particularly exposed to adverse economic, regulatory, political, legal, geographical, and other changes affecting the issuers of infrastructure related securities. Infrastructure related companies are subject to a variety of factors that may adversely affect their business or operations, including high interest costs in connection with capital construction programs, difficulties in obtaining financing for construction programs, costs associated with environmental and other regulations, the effects of economic slowdown, surplus capacity, increased competition from other providers of services, uncertainties concerning the availability of fuel at reasonable prices, the effects of energy conservation policies, changes in market sentiment and other factors. Additionally, infrastructure related companies may be subject to regulation by various governmental authorities, may also be affected by governmental regulation of rates charged to customers, service interruption, and/or legal challenges due to environmental, operational, the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws, regulatory policies, and accounting standards. There is also the risk that corruption may negatively affect infrastructure projects, resulting in delays and cost overruns.
Leverage Risk:  The use of leverage creates an opportunity for increased common share net investment income dividends, but also creates risks for the holders of common shares. Leverage is a speculative technique that exposes the Fund to greater risk, and increased costs. Leverage may cause greater changes in the Fund's NAV. The Fund will also have to pay interest on its borrowings, if any, which may reduce the Fund's return.
Equity Securities Risk:  Equity securities prices have historically experienced periods of significant volatility, particularly during recessions or other periods of financial stress. Common stock prices, like other equity securities may be affected by macroeconomics and other factors affecting the stock market in general, including financial or political conditions that may affect particular industries, or the economy in general. Preferred stocks are subject to issuer specific risks, in addition to the general equity risks, and unlike common stocks, participation in the growth of an issuer may be limited.
Foreign Securities Risk : Foreign securities can be subject to greater risks than U.S. investments, including currency fluctuations, less liquid trading markets, greater price volatility, political and economic instability, less publicly available information, and changes in tax or currency laws or monetary policy. These risks are likely to be greater for emerging markets than in developed markets. 
Convertible Securities Risk:  The value of a convertible security, which is a form of hybrid security (i.e., a security with both debt and equity characteristics), typically increases or decreases with the price of the underlying common stock. In general, a convertible security is subject to the market risks of stocks, and its price may be as volatile as that of the underlying stock, when the underlying stock's price is high relative to the conversion price, and a convertible security is subject to the market risks of debt securities, and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates, when the underlying stock 's price is low relative to the conversion price. The general market risks of debt securities that are common to convertible securities include, but are not limited to, interest rate risk and credit risk, they are subject to the risk that the issuer will not be able to pay interest or dividends when due; their market value may change based on changes in the issuer's credit rating or the market's perception of the issuer's creditworthiness.
Debt Securities Risk:  The risks involved with investing in debt securities include (without limitation) credit risk, the risk that an issuer, guarantor, or liquidity provider of a debt security may be unable or unwilling, or may be perceived (whether by market participants, ratings agencies, pricing services or otherwise) as unable or unwilling, to make timely principal and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations.
Maturity Risk:  Maturity, the average expected repayment date of the Fund's portfolio, taking into account the expected final repayment dates of the securities in the portfolio. A debt security with a longer maturity may fluctuate in value more than a debt security with a shorter maturity. Therefore, the NAV of the Fund that holds debt securities with a longer average maturity may fluctuate in value more than the NAV of the Fund that holds debt securities with a shorter average maturity.
Investment and Market Discount Risk:  An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest. As with any stock, the price of the Fund's Common Shares will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At any point in time an investment in the Fund's Common Shares may be worth less than the original amount invested, even after taking into account distributions paid by the Fund. The Fund uses leverage, which will magnify the Fund's investment, market, and certain other risks.
Dividend Paying Securities Risk : Dividends the Fund receives on common stocks are not fixed but are declared at the discretion of an issuer's board of directors. There is no guarantee that the issuers of the securities held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if dividends are declared, they will remain at their current levels or increase over time. The Fund's emphasis on dividend paying securities could cause the Fund to underperform versus similar funds that invest without consideration of a company's track record of paying dividends or ability to pay dividends in the future. Dividend paying securities may not participate in a broad market advance to the same degree as other securities, and a sharp rise in interest rates or an economic downturn could cause a company to unexpectedly reduce or eliminate its dividend.
Discount from Net Asset Value Risk:  Shares of closed end investment companies frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value. This characteristic is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that the Fund's NAV per Common Share could decrease as a result of its investment activities. The net asset value per Common Share will be reduced immediately following this offering as a result of the payment of certain offering costs. Although the value of the Fund's net assets is generally considered by market participants in determining whether to purchase or sell Common Shares, whether investors will realize gains or losses upon the sale of the Common Shares will depend entirely upon whether the market price of the Common Shares at the time of sale is above or below the investor's purchase price for the Common Shares. Because the market price of the Common Shares will be determined by factors such as net asset value, dividend and distribution levels and their stability (which will in turn be affected by levels of dividend and interest payments by the Fund's portfolio holdings, the timing and success of the Fund's investment strategies, regulations affecting the timing and character of Fund distributions, Fund expenses and other factors), supply of and demand for the Common Shares, trading volume of the Common Shares, general market, interest rate and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of the Fund, the Fund cannot predict whether the Common Shares will trade at, below or above net asset value or at, below or above the initial public offering price.
Emerging Markets Risk:  The risks of foreign investments (or exposure to foreign investments) are usually much greater when they are made in (or result in exposure to) emerging markets. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative. Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. They are more likely to experience high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which may adversely affect returns. In addition, many emerging markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets, may be more likely to suffer sharp and frequent price changes or long-term price depression due to possible adverse publicity, investor perceptions, or the actions of a few large investors. Also, there may be less publicly available information about issuers in emerging markets, and such issuers may not be subject to accounting, auditing, recordkeeping, and financial reporting standards and requirements comparable to those to which companies in developed markets are.
Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing. The Fund's prospectus, which contains this and other information about the Fund, should be read carefully before investing. A copy of the prospectus relating to this Fund may be obtained by contacting your financial advisor, or by calling 800-624-6782.

Full text: Stand Up To Cancer Media Contacts: Fiona McRobert, fmcrobert@su2c.org; Alison Ashford, aashford@su2c.org; Jazz Media Contact: Kristin Bhavnani, Head of Global Corporate Communications, Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc, CorporateAffairsMediaInfo@jazzpharma.com, Ireland +353 1 637 2141, U.S. +1 215 867 4948
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Stand Up To Cancer ® (SU2C) announced today the launch of a new public service announcement (PSA) campaign in partnership with Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc. The PSA aims to raise awareness in Black and Hispanic communities about small cell lung cancer and encourage listeners to learn about screening options. The radio PSA campaign launches nationally today in both English and Spanish.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and affects some communities more severely than others. Small cell lung cancer is a fast-growing type of lung cancer commonly caused by smoking; however, it often affects non-smokers who have been exposed to secondhand smoke, radon, air pollution, or other factors. When small cell lung cancer is detected early, before it has spread, patients benefit from more treatment options that can significantly increase survival rates. Black Americans are 18% less likely to be diagnosed early and Latinos are 16% less likely, compared to white Americans. This PSA campaign aims to generate awareness in these communities about the need for regular lung cancer screenings, with a goal of early detection and diagnosis to have the best opportunity for optimal treatment outcomes.
"This PSA campaign is an important component of our efforts to improve cancer health equity to ensure diverse patient populations have equal access to health care and important cancer treatments," said Russell Chew, president and CEO of Stand Up To Cancer. "Additionally, we are incredibly thankful to Jazz Pharmaceuticals for the company's support of SU2C's Catalyst program, including research to investigate potential new treatments for non-small cell lung cancer."
"Jazz is committed to transforming the lives of patients and their families, and our collaboration with Stand Up To Cancer on this PSA campaign aims to spread awareness of small cell lung cancer and encourage early screening. Early detection and diagnosis is essential to give people with small cell lung cancer the opportunity of improved outcomes, especially in minority communities," said Kelvin Tan MB BCh, MRCPCH, senior vice president and chief medical officer of Jazz Pharmaceuticals.
Stand Up To Cancer recently announced the funding of three SU2C Catalyst ® research projects with support from Jazz Pharmaceuticals. The first is the SU2C Catalyst LiFFT Study, which will explore the safety and efficacy of lurbinectedin in Adolescent and Young Adult Ewing sarcomas. The second is the SU2C Catalyst Lung Cancer Combination Therapeutics Team, which will use pre-clinical models to identify which existing targeted therapeutic agents, when combined with the Jazz Pharmaceuticals compound JZP815, may lead to testing in patients with KRAS-mutated non-small cell lung cancer to improve their outcomes. The last project, the Digital Ethnography Study, uses an innovative methodology to analyze web-based conversations about barriers to lung cancer treatment and participation in clinical trials in underserved patient populations including different racial and ethnic populations. These efforts are part of SU2C's Health Equity Initiative, which aims to decrease disparities in cancer care and works towards making every cancer patient a long-term survivor.
The radio PSA was developed by SU2C with radio mixing by Tono Studios.

ABOUT GARTH BROOKS Garth Brooks just completed the three and a half year long Stadium Tour. It drew an average of more than 95 thousand people in each city it played and was seen by a cumulative audience of nearly three-million people. The tour ended in September when Garth played the fifth sold-out concert at Dublin, Ireland's Croke Park. The five concerts were seen by over 400-thousand people. Also in September, Garth was honored with the Kris Kristofferson Lifetime Achievement Award at the NSAI's Nashville Songwriter Awards, held at the Ryman Auditorium. 
On sale now is "The Anthology, Part II: The Next Five Years." In this Anthology, Garth picks up where he left off in "The Anthology, Part I: The First Five Years," telling his story in his own words and offering fascinating insights to his career and personal life from 1996-2001.
In May 2021, Garth Brooks was one of five artists to receive one of the most prestigious honors an artist can receive, The Kennedy Center Honor. Garth is the first-ever seven-time recipient of the CMA Entertainer of the Year honor. Brooks is the first and only artist in history to receive nine Diamond Awards for the now nine diamond-certified albums at over 10 million album sales each. He remains the #1-selling solo artist in U.S. history, certified by the RIAA with 157 million album sales. Last year, he was awarded Country Touring Artist of the Decade at the 2021 Pollstar Awards. In March 2020, Garth received the esteemed Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. The event aired on PBS. He has received every accolade the recording industry can bestow on an artist.
In November 2020, just after receiving the Billboard Music Icon Award, Garth released two new albums, his 12th studio album, "FUN" and live album "Triple Live Deluxe."
After the success of "Garth & Trisha Live!" during prime time on CBS in April 2020, CBS also aired "Garth & Trisha Live! A Holiday Concert Event," in December. Both specials featured Garth and Trisha taking song requests through Facebook, live from their studio, Allentown, in Nashville.
In November of 2019, A&E aired "Garth Brooks: The Road I'm On," over two consecutive nights. Part of their esteemed 'Biography' franchise, the documentary offered an intimate look at Garth's life as a musician and father over his entire career.
In January 2020, Billboard announced that Garth Brooks was the first artist to make it on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in the 80s, 90s, 00s, 10s and now 20s. Garth debuted "Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)" in 1989. Now, with "Dive Bar," a duet he sang with Blake Shelton, he makes his appearance on the list in 2020. The single inspired a DIVE BAR tour to dive bars in country music capitals around the country which will continue its run of stops through 2022.
Last year, Garth went vinyl with his meticulously-curated vinyl package, LEGACY. This career-defining collection includes No Fences, The Chase, In Pieces, Fresh Horses and Triple Live, plus CDs with bonus tracks for a total of 7 vinyl albums and 7 CDs in each edition.
In 2017, Garth finished the three-and-a-half-year long Garth Brooks World Tour with Trisha Yearwood. The tour sold over 6.3 million tickets, making it the biggest North American tour in history and the biggest American tour in the world.

Full text: EAST GREENBUSH, N.Y., Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center ® (MS-ISAC ® ), part of the Center for Internet Security (CIS), released a new report Monday detailing the cybersecurity challenges faced by K-12 schools along with steps they can take to improve their cyber defenses.
The K-12 Report uncovers findings on cybersecurity preparedness and threats from the 2021 Nationwide Cybersecurity Review (NCSR), along with the MS-ISAC's robust database of threat intelligence, service data, and feedback from its more than 3500 members, from among K-12 schools and districts. Some key findings include:
- Schools are data-rich and can be resource-poor, making them particularly lucrative targets for cyber threat actors
- The average school spends less than 8% of its IT budget on cybersecurity, with one in five schools committing less than 1%
- 29% of K-12 MS-ISAC member organizations reported being victims of a cyber incident

Overall, the MS-ISAC assesses that cyber threat actors are highly likely to target K-12 school districts in the remainder of the 2022-2023 school year. The K-12 sector is improving its cybersecurity capabilities over time, but lags behind other sectors in terms of cybersecurity program maturity. With the release of the report, the MS-ISAC hopes to drive further cyber improvements across the K-12 community, while highlighting no-cost cybersecurity resources available to MS-ISAC member schools and districts.
"This MS-ISAC K-12 Report is intended to arm K-12 leaders with the information to make informed decisions around cyber risk while giving K-12 IT and cyber professionals a healthy understanding of the cyber threat landscape and practical guidance for improving cyber defenses," said Karen Sorady, MS-ISAC Vice President for Member Engagement.
"One of the most powerful decisions a K-12 school district can make is to become an active member of the MS-ISAC," said John Wargo, Director of Technology at K-12 Educational Service Agency. "In my 35 years in the K-12 community, I have not found a better way to receive the intelligence and cybersecurity resources to help mount an effective cyber defense—and at little-to-no cost."
To speak with Karen Sorady, Vice President of Member Engagement at the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), please contact Kelly Wyland at  348573@email4pr.com or call/text 518-256-6978.

Full text: Special Highlight: Impeccably documented gold-embellished Smith & Wesson .44 Magnum custom ordered by Elvis Presley, decorated by legendary Las Vegas engraver Joseph Condon
DENVER, Pa., Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Two days of unprecedented buying opportunities await bidders at Morphy Auctions' Nov. 15-16 Extraordinary Firearms & Militaria Auction. A breathtaking 800-lot selection of rare military and civilian arms follows a timeline that runs from the early 18th century through contemporary times. Several lots are historically significant, with ties to Civil War legends and even "The King" himself, Elvis Presley.
Perhaps no other collectible firearms category has been as intensely sought after in the past decade as legally transferable machine guns. Their sale is federally controlled, and Morphy's team of firearms experts makes sure all paperwork and documentation are in place before such guns are offered at auction. Per BATF regulations, Morphy's also ensures that the bureau has approved the winner bidder before any controlled firearm is transferred to them.
Collectors can look forward to seeing some extraordinary rarities in the November sale. The star of the show is a fully transferable, high-condition Fabrique National US M240B machine gun, an example of the model that the United States armed forces chose to replace the M60 machine gun in December 1995. M240Bs are extremely scarce in the NFA Registry, which notes the existence of 17 pre-1986 dealer samples and possibly up to 11 fully transferable examples. Displaying near-mint, original unfired condition, this specimen would be "hard to improve upon," said Dan Morphy, president of Morphy Auctions. Estimate: $250,000-$500,000
Also, for the advanced collector, Morphy's offers twin Colt M2 water-cooled machine guns on a Mark 22 naval ship mount with a Heintz armored shield and array of accessories. The consignor states that until these two Colts were retrieved from long-time storage, only 21 other transferable, registered original M2 water-cooled .50s were known to be in private ownership in the United States. This rare water-cooled M2s in its original configuration is estimated at $200,000-$250,000
Elvis Presley (1935-1977) had few close friends outside of his trusted circle of bodyguards and associates known as the "Memphis Mafia." Among them was Lamar Fike, who received a birthday present from Presley that was one of a kind: a specially commissioned Smith & Wesson 29-2 .44 Magnum revolver. Presley spared no expense, having it embellished in gold and engraved by Las Vegas gun engraver to the stars Joseph Condon. Impeccably documented, its estimate is $100,000-$150,000.
To this day, Civil War buffs discuss the pros and cons of radical abolitionist John Brown, who was executed in 1859 after his failed incitement of a slave rebellion at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. Was he a heroic martyr or a madman and terrorist? There may never be a definitive answer. Nevertheless, Brown is endlessly fascinating as a historical figure, and collectors of Civil War-era firearms will surely be competing over the Sharps Model 1853 single-shot slant-breech carbine taken from John Brown's arsenal by the Independent Greys at the raid on Harpers Ferry. The carbine is inscribed on the patchbox: Captured by the / Independent Greys/ At the Insurrection at Harpers Ferry / Oct. 18th 1859/ R. Wm. Grahame . Estimate: $30,000-$60,000
Morphy's Nov. 15-16, 2022 Extraordinary Firearms & Militaria Auction will start at 9AM on both days. All forms of bidding will be available, including live online via Morphy Live. Questions: call 877-968-8880, email info@morphyauctions.com. Online: www.morphyauctions.com.

- Launched in 2019 with Zillow, Housing Connector takes a business-to-business approach to leverage existing housing in the private market to address homelessness
- Currently operates in Seattle and Denver, will announce expansion to third market in 2023

SEATTLE, Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Housing Connector , which uses Zillow-powered technology to help match people in need of a home with affordable vacant units, has successfully placed 3,754 people in homes during its first three years of operation. Housing Connector launched in Seattle through a collaboration among civic leaders, service providers and Zillow in the fall of 2019. The program  expanded regionally  in 2021, then into  Denver last November.  The program will expand again in 2023, with a formal announcement anticipated early next year. 
"Our program was designed to make sure that no home sits empty while there are people in need of a roof over their heads," said Shkëlqim Kelmendi, founder and executive director of Housing Connector. "This business-to-business approach is a win for everyone, serving as a bridge for property owners with vacant apartments to connect with case managers and ready-to-rent tenants. Tapping into existing, available homes is an effective and efficient way to remove barriers to housing for people living unsheltered. Being able to afford and maintain rent is a struggle for most people – even more so for vulnerable people already experiencing homelessness." 
Housing affordability is a crisis in communities across the country. The typical  monthly rent  in the U.S. is over $2,000 a month nationally, which is 37% higher than five years ago. Sharp increases in rent have a direct impact on  rates of homelessness  and are considered by policymakers to be a  primary cause of housing instability . These factors more severely impact people of color, who experience homelessness at a higher rate  than white people in the United States.
"Thousands of people have a home today because of Housing Connector's incredible work in three short years," said Aldona Clottey, vice president of corporate social responsibility at Zillow. "We were founded on 'Turning on the Lights' for people navigating a complex and often difficult journey when trying to find a home. Our technology has helped achieve that in real estate and we want to offer this expertise for those facing the challenge of finding a way out of homelessness. Housing Connector is a direct outcome of bringing these pieces together, which has 'Turned on the Lights' for people that had been experiencing homelessness and now have an affordable place to call home."
Who has been helped by Housing Connector 
Through Housing Connector, 3,754 people – 66% of which are in households of color – have found long-term housing in the Seattle and Denver metro areas. The majority of program participants earn less than $28,000 a year. For perspective, the typical renter in Seattle and Denver will spend around that amount annually on rent alone, paying $27,420 and $24,335 respectively, according to  Zillow data .
"I worked in construction for 30 years," said Jeffery Gill, resident at Capella Apartments at Esterra Park in Redmond, Washington and a Housing Connector client. "After I got hurt, I couldn't work enough to make ends meet and I found myself living in a shelter for three years. Thankfully, my case manager stuck with me and was able to find a place that would take my housing voucher. Within a few weeks, I was living in a brand-new apartment, which is helping me get my feet underneath me again. This whole experience has given me hope that I can buy a place of my own again sometime down the road. This program really helped me, and I know it can help others, too."
How it works for property owners 
Property owners, managers and landlords are critical to the program's success. In three years, more than 1,300 properties across the Seattle and Denver metros have listed with Housing Connector, representing more than 73,000 homes. Properties enrolled in the program adjust or waive criteria (credit, rental history, etc.) for residents and list their property through Zillow's search tool that is only accessible to case managers and their clients participating in the program.
"Housing Connector's strategy for housing people and keeping them housed is the first one that's worked in a long time – if ever," said Jenny Domoto of Milestone Properties in Washington state. "With affordable housing so scarce, case managers can struggle to find places for their clients. With Housing Connector, a case manager can more easily place a client in one of our properties and then the client gets the support they need to remain housed. It's been a positive experience and we see it as a way for us to be part of the solution to help end homelessness in our community."
"As a leader in affordable housing, with decades of experience managing thousands of rental units across the western United States, we knew immediately the value Housing Connector would bring to Denver's affordable housing landscape," Brooke Parra, executive vice president of Ross-Envolve Communities. "Through this partnership, once a vacancy comes up, our community managers list the vacancy and Housing Connector's partners can find the unit and begin placing a tenant. It's a win for our properties, the community, and our tenants."
Once a client is matched to an available affordable home, Housing Connector provides them with two years of guaranteed housing stability support. In exchange, property owners receive access to financial and mitigation support, opening up housing that was previously out of reach for people experiencing homelessness.
"Thanks to our strong partnership with Housing Connector, we are proud to have assisted with finding housing for more than a dozen households in just four months in Redmond, as well as in Kirkland and Bellevue," said Angela Birney, mayor of Redmond. "This is a great example of what working together and leveraging connections can do for the betterment of our community."
How the tool works for community service providers 
Community providers, such as the city of Redmond and Volunteers of America in Denver, use Housing Connector to place clients in participating properties. In total, 162 community providers partner with Housing Connector to access listings and find homes for their clients.
"I work with individuals who could have moved into housing years ago -- many of them living in their cars while also working -- if there had been available affordable housing for them," said Tisza Rutherford, Homeless Outreach Administrator for the city of Redmond. "Without this opportunity, they would probably be continuing to do that, while whittling away at their credit and paying off past debt. This program is launching people into housing much faster, and sets them up for success."
The search tool directly addresses one of the biggest challenges for case managers: finding available long-term housing that is accessible to their clients. With the tool, case managers no longer have to manually review or contact properties to see if clients are eligible; available units are now at their fingertips through the online listing platform.
"Housing Connector has been incredible since coming to Denver," said Nicole Brown, Case Manager for Volunteers of America Colorado. "I've been able to use the search tool with clients to find affordable units in the Denver area that can work for them, and then Housing Connector steps in to either help take care of deposits or troubleshoot with property managers to make sure everyone can stay housed. It's really helpful for people facing multiple barriers. I hope more property managers and case managers take advantage of this opportunity; it helps everyone in the community."
Zillow's  Social Impact program leverages our products and platform to help advance housing security and economic opportunity for underserved communities. This work includes partnerships like Housing Connector and product features such as displaying down payment assistance programs for prospective home-buyers and including fair housing resources and local legal protections on home listings.
About Housing Connector 
Housing Connector is a nonprofit organization that helps private property owners and landlords easily and successfully rent to people experiencing homelessness. Housing Connector takes a business-to-business approach based on the belief that leveraging existing housing in the private market can meaningfully reduce homelessness. Housing Connector's partnerships offer a cost-effective model for housing, costing roughly $3,900 to place and support a household in a property for two years.

Full text: Major Milestones for SunZia Wind and Transmission Projects Pave Way for Largest Clean Energy Infrastructure Project in U.S. History
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. and TUCSON, Ariz., Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pattern Energy Group LP (Pattern Energy), a leader in renewable energy, announced its SunZia Transmission project received unanimous approval from the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) on its recent Certificate of Environmental Compatibility application, representing the completion of the AZ state permitting process. Pattern Energy also announced that its SunZia Wind Projects received two separate unanimous approvals from the New Mexico Public Regulatory Commission related to its more than 3,500 megawatt (MW) SunZia Wind project in central New Mexico. The projects continue to work with federal agencies including the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), as well as local jurisdictions and stakeholders, to finalize remaining approvals to allow construction on the projects to begin on schedule in mid-2023.
The SunZia Wind project represents over 3,500 MW of new renewable generation located in Torrance, Lincoln, and San Miguel Counties, New Mexico and will represent the largest wind project in the Western Hemisphere. SunZia Transmission is a 550-mile ± 525 kV high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line between central New Mexico and south-central Arizona, with the capacity to transport 3,000 MW of clean, renewable energy. Together, SunZia Wind and Transmission comprise the largest renewable energy infrastructure project in U.S. history with a total investment of more than $8 billion and enough energy to power the needs of more than 3 million Americans. Both projects are privately funded and will deliver over $1 billion in estimated direct economic benefits to governments, communities, schools, and private landowners across Arizona and New Mexico.
The SunZia Wind and SunZia Transmission projects have been developed with a deep commitment to local community engagement and environmental stewardship. A key initiative for SunZia has been following through on an extended engagement with local, regional, and national conservation stakeholders. As a result of this commitment and consultation, SunZia Transmission is setting a precedent with a gold standard in environmental mitigation projects developed hand-in-hand with the environmental community. SunZia Wind has established robust environmental best practices to reduce project impacts and study effective habitat restoration strategies in partnership with local and state experts.
"We thank Arizona and New Mexico for welcoming SunZia Transmission and SunZia Wind," said Mike Garland, CEO of Pattern Energy. "The unanimous decision by the ACC to grant a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility for the SunZia Transmission line represents a major milestone towards the completion of this project. We are excited to get to work on the revolutionary SunZia Transmission line which will be the conduit for the largest wind project in U.S. history, our 3,500+ MW SunZia Wind facility in New Mexico. Once complete these projects will combine to increase the reliability of the western grid, create good jobs, and bring millions of dollars in economic benefits to Arizona and New Mexico. We look forward to continuing to work with federal agencies and local jurisdictions to finalize remaining approvals for construction to begin in 2023."
"This project is of great economic benefit with more than 2,000 construction jobs and up to 150 permanent jobs, which for our rural communities is a lifeline," said Mignonne Hollis, Executive Director, Arizona Regional Economic Development Foundation. "It's vital for our county, which continues to see a decline in population, to have stable jobs come into our region."
"SunZia is proof that New Mexico is leading the charge in the clean energy transition," said U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich. "Once completed, this project will result in the largest wind farm in the Western Hemisphere, producing thousands of construction jobs and delivering billions in private capital investments that will ignite rural economic development across the Southwest."
Originally approved in 2015, SunZia Transmission's route was adjusted as a result of collaboration with the Department of Defense and White Sands Missile Range, while also taking advantage of the opportunity to partially parallel the existing Western Spirit Transmission line for 35 miles, minimizing environmental impact along the route. Final project approvals including the BLM Record of Decision are anticipated to be issued by April 2023.
Throughout the development process, the SunZia Wind and Transmission Projects have worked closely with the public, BLM, landowners, ranchers, and numerous wildlife conservation agencies such as the Audubon Society and Defenders of Wildlife, to foster productive dialogue about the environmental review of these projects, listen to concerns and recommendations, and incorporate feedback from these communities to make the projects more environmentally compatible as a result of this engagement.

CN Energy Group. Inc. Has Obtained the Permit to Directly Sell to Drinkable Water Markets

Full text: LISHUI, China, Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- CN Energy Group. Inc. (NASDAQ: CNEY) today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Zhejiang CN Energy New Material Co., Ltd. has recently been awarded an official permit to sell its wood-based activated carbon products directly to domestic drinking water markets, after satisfying all increasingly more stringent requirements on safety and environmental protection. This is a significant milestone for CNEY to expand its business networks, reinforce its competitive strength and enhance its revenue sources. With such a permit, CNEY can now provide high-quality customized products and services under its own brand names to the vast majority of end-users, with remarkable improvements in reliability, sustainability and responsiveness, while avoiding "deadweight losses" caused by multilevel intermediaries. This supply-chain streamlining will not only generate tangible economic and ecologic benefits for general societies but will also deliver more decent returns to its shareholders.
According to the World Bank, accessing to sufficient and safe drinking water is a fundamental social infrastructure and thus requires large-scale investments over decades to secure basic public health and sanitation conditions, especially in populous countries like China and during challenging times of fighting against pandemics and climate change. With rapid urbanization and income growth, the demand for treated drinking water in China has already been gigantic (valued at around US$70 billion currently per year) and will continue to grow at a fast pace in the foreseeable future.  CNEY's activated carbon products, completely made from forest wastes and agricultural residues, can be effectively utilized in a wide spectrum of industrial and residential applications, ranging from soil improvement, sewage treatment, water purification, odor absorption to impurity removal. They are indispensable in food, beverage, pharmaceutical and chemical industries.  It is evident that, with its outstanding R&D capabilities and newly renovated manufacturing facilities, CNEY stands strategically ready to capture these enormous market opportunities in both urban and rural areas and to launch global sales campaigns.

Full text: Founder of Aesthetic IQ offers non-invasive procedures at Scottsdale clinic
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- It's time to think beyond Botox. There are so many more possibilities for enhancing one's appearance nowadays. The beauty industry is expanding thanks to the FDA's recent approval of a number of novel cosmetic treatments. Marissa Abdo, MS, RN, CANS, top trainer, and founder of Aesthetic IQ, shares the most recent procedures available on the market to help you feel confident and attractive in your skin.
Abdo is the creator of Aesthetic IQ, a brand-new medical aesthetic clinic, and a top national trainer for Galderma and Allergan with more than ten years of expertise in the field. Her mission with Aesthetic IQ is to ensure that patients are receiving the safest and most effective natural injectable care for their facial, eye, and skin conditions. The clinic bridges the gap between the art and science of injectables by utilizing the power of the senses to provide effective treatments, the best possible outcomes, and an elevated aesthetic experience.
"I'm constantly searching for ways to help my clientele look and feel their best while also providing them with the high-quality treatments they deserve," said Marissa Abdo, Aesthetic IQ Founder. "I'm excited to educate the general public about these new procedures because I believe that the more people who are aware of the procedures that are accessible, the easier it will be for them to achieve their desired appearance."
The following treatments, according to Abdo, are non-invasive, require minimal downtime, carry very little risk, and minimize the effects of normal aging:
- Sculptra Aesthetics: Sculptra is an FDA-approved one-of-a-kind aesthetic treatment that encourages the growth of natural collagen to add firmness to the skin. It contains PLLA, which acts as a collagen stimulator, helping to gradually restore fullness to facial wrinkles and folds. We like to describe it as "fertilizer" for your face because it provides a natural volume replacement that can last for more than two years. This treatment helps soften fine lines and wrinkles in a very natural way.
- QWO: This FDA-approved injectable treats moderate to severe cellulite in the buttocks. The enzymes in QWO - called collagenases - work in three ways by releasing fibrous bands, redistributing fat cells, and stimulating the growth of new collagen. QWO works by breaking up those fibrous bands that cause the appearance of cellulite. It is by far the most sought-after treatment for 2022.
- Restylane Contour: This new hyaluronic acid (HA) filler was recently approved by the FDA for cheek augmentation and the correction of midface contour deficiencies in adults 21 years or older. It is Galderma's only product in the United States to use proprietary XpresHAn Technology™ for the cheeks.

For more information about the mentioned procedures or to find out if you'd be a good candidate for one of the above treatments, call 480.454.5577, visit AestheticIQClinic.com or visit their location at 7054 E Cochise Rd. B200 Scottsdale, AZ 85253. You can follow the clinic on social media at - @Marissa.AestheticIQ.

Full text: - New drug application (NDA) for zilucoplan seeks approval for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are acetylcholine receptor antibody positive (AChR-Ab+)

- Acceptance by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) follows the recent European Medicines Agency (EMA) validation of Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for treatment of adult patients with AChR-Ab+ gMG and who require treatment in addition to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressants

- Both NDA and MAA are based on pivotal Phase 3 RAISE study in gMG, which demonstrated treatment with zilucoplan resulted in clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in key MG-specific outcomes compared to placebo

- UCB expects to receive feedback from the agencies in Q4 of 2023

BRUSSELS and ATLANTA, Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- UCB, a global biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the New Drug Application (NDA) for its investigational treatment, zilucoplan.
Zilucoplan is a subcutaneous (SC), self-administered peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) for the treatment of adult patients with acetylcholine receptor antibody positive (AChR-Ab+) generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG).
In 2019, the U.S. FDA granted orphan drug designation to zilucoplan for the treatment of MG. 1 The safety and efficacy of zilucoplan have not been established and it is not currently approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.
This acceptance follows the recent European Medicines Agency (EMA) validation of the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for zilucoplan for the treatment of adult patients with AChR-Ab+ gMG and who require treatment in addition to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressants. Validation confirms that the application is complete and the formal review process by the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) can begin. Orphan designation was granted in 2022 by the European Commission to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis. 2  
gMG is a chronic and unpredictable auto-immune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane. This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction. 4 People living with MG can experience a variety of symptoms, including drooping eyelids, double vision, and difficulty in swallowing, chewing and talking, as well as severe muscle weakness that can result in life-threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration. 3 In the U.S. the prevalence of MG is estimated at 14 to 20 per 100,000 population; approximately 36,000 to 60,000 cases. 4 In Europe, the prevalence is estimated at 10 per 100,000 population. 5
"People living with gMG experience high treatment burden, on top of the debilitating impact of the condition, and there is a clear need for additional targeted treatments to support the gMG community. Our goal is to provide a solution that can help meet these needs and transform lives," said Charl van Zyl, Executive Vice President Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International Markets, UCB. "The acceptance of the NDA by the FDA as well as the acceptance of the MAA by the EMA, brings us one step further on our journey towards approval for this medicine. We look forward to working with the FDA and EMA to help bring this important new treatment option to patients."
The NDA and MAA are based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 RAISE study (NCT04115293), which demonstrated at week 12 that treatment with zilucoplan (0.3 mg/kg daily) resulted in clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in key gMG-specific outcomes compared with placebo in patients with AChR-Ab+ gMG. The study met its primary endpoint with zilucoplan showing a placebo-corrected mean improvement of 2.09 points in the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score at week 12 (p 6
Zilucoplan demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile, showing a similar rate of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) between zilucoplan (76.7%) and placebo (70.5%). The most common TEAEs were injection site bruising, headache, and diarrhea. Rates of treatment discontinuation due to a TEAE were low and all patients who completed the 12-week treatment period have entered the ongoing RAISE-XT open-label extension study (NCT04225871). 6 ,7
In the RAISE study, 174 adult patients were randomised to receive daily SC, self-administered doses of placebo (N=88) or zilucoplan 0.3 mg/kg (N=86). Patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between treatment arms. 6
As a complement C5 inhibitor, zilucoplan is a targeted therapy that inhibits key components in the underlying pathophysiology of gMG, addressing the underlying mechanism of neuromuscular junction damage. 8,9
"We are deeply committed to improving outcomes for the gMG community. People who live with gMG suffer unpredictable, fluctuating, and debilitating symptoms, which have a huge impact on their lives. We want to help reduce the day-to-day burden of this challenging disease," said Iris Loew-Friedrich, Executive Vice-President and Chief Medical Officer at UCB. " If approved, zilucoplan has the potential to address the unmet need for people with gMG by providing targeted improvements in signs and symptoms of gMG disease activity and severity . A benefit of targeted treatment is that it may help reduce the adverse events that can be associated with non-specific immunosuppressive treatment of gMG."
UCB anticipates making regulatory filings for zilucoplan in gMG in Great Britain, Japan, and rest of the world from Q3 2022 onwards.
Alongside zilucoplan, UCB is also investigating rozanolixizumab, a SC-administered, humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds, with high affinity, to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), as a potential treatment for gMG. UCB anticipates filing regulatory submissions for rozanolixizumab later this year. 10

About Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG) Myasthenia gravis is a rare disease impacting more than 700,000 people worldwide. 11 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms, including drooping eyelids, double vision, difficulty swallowing, chewing and talking, as well as severe muscular weakness that can result in life threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration. 3 , 4
gMG is a chronic and unpredictable auto-immune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane. This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction. 4 , 12  gMG can occur in any race, although previous studies have shown that women are more often impacted than men. 13,14 Most patients with gMG have pathogenic IgG antibodies that disrupt the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles in the NMJ and some activate the complement cascade. 15 Complement-mediated destruction via MAC formation is a key mechanism causing damage at the NMJ and is the key driver of disease in AChR-Ab+ gMG.
About the zilucoplan RAISE study 6 , 7 The RAISE study (NCT04115293) is a multi-center, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to confirm the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of zilucoplan in patients with AChR-Ab+ gMG. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily subcutaneous (SC) doses of 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan or placebo for 12 weeks.
The primary endpoint for the RAISE study is change from baseline to Week 12 in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score. Secondary endpoints include change in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score, the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) and the Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life 15 revised (MG-QoL15r) score from baseline to Week 12, time to rescue therapy, the proportion with minimal symptom expression (MSE) (defined as MG-ADL of 0 or 1), the proportion with a ≥3-point reduction in MG-ADL and the proportion with a ≥5-point reduction in QMG without rescue therapy, all measured at Week 12. The secondary safety endpoint is incidence of TEAEs. Patients who completed the 12 week RAISE trial had the possibility to enter the open label extension study, RAISE-XT.
For more information about the trial visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04115293.
About Zilucoplan Zilucoplan is a once-daily SC, self-administered peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) under clinical development by UCB in gMG. As a C5 inhibitor, zilucoplan inhibits complement-mediated damage to the neuromuscular junction through its targeted dual mechanism of action. 9  In 2019, the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis. 1  Orphan designation was granted in 2022 by the European Commission to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis. 2
The safety and efficacy of zilucoplan have not been established and it is not currently approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.
About Rozanolixizumab Rozanolixizumab is an SC administered, humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds, with high affinity, to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). It has been designed to block the interaction of FcRn and Immunoglobulin G (IgG), accelerating the catabolism of antibodies and reducing the concentration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies. 16, 15
Rozanolixizumab is under clinical development with the aim of improving the lives of people with pathogenic IgG-autoantibody-driven autoimmune diseases. In 2019, the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of myasthenia gravis. 17 Orphan designation was granted in 2020 18 by the European Commission for rozanolixizumab to the treatment of myasthenia gravis.
The safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab have not been established and it is not approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.

Forward looking statements This press release may contain forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements containing the words "believes", "anticipates", "expects", "intends", "plans", "seeks", "estimates", "may", "will", "continue" and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on current plans, estimates and beliefs of management. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial information, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature, such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results, financial condition, performance or achievements of UCB, or industry results, to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19, changes in general economic, business and competitive conditions, the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing, costs associated with research and development, changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB, effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations, safety, quality, data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches, or disruptions of our information technology systems, product liability claims, challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates, competition from other products including biosimilars, changes in laws or regulations, exchange rate fluctuations, changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws, and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline, will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far, the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models, cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships, joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe, effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB' efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition.

Full text: PORSGRUNN, Norway, Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Reference is made to the recent press release from DG Fuels regarding a long-term SAF and carbon credit offtake agreement with an undisclosed investment grade industrial buyer. With this agreement, combined with previously announced offtake agreements, DG Fuels has sold out 100% of the expected initial production of approximately 120 million gallons per year.
HydrogenPro will supply its green hydrogen technology with a capacity of at least 839 MW for DG Fuels' initial production plant in Louisiana, USA. At current market prices, total purchases under the initial five-year minimum term of this combined SAF and carbon credit purchase agreement exceeds USD 4 billion.
" DG Fuels securing an annual offtake of 120 million gallons is of great importance for HydrogenPro. We are the chosen supplier of electrolysis equipment to this enormous project, and we look forward to continuing playing an active role globally in decarbonising the future, " says Richard Espeseth, interim CEO and founder of HydrogenPro.
Delivery of SAF and carbon credits under the agreement are expected to begin in late 2026 or early 2027. The use of SAF can reduce emissions by an average of 80% compared to conventional fuel and is considered more energy efficient. Hence, it provides airlines with operational advantages in addition to its environmental contributions.
About HydrogenPro:
HydrogenPro is a technology company and an OEM for high pressure alkaline electrolyser and supplies large scale green hydrogen plants, all ISO 9001, ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 certified.

Full text: - Cboe Clear Europe remains committed to an open-access approach to its clearing services, by continuing to serve multiple exchanges and venues
- New name provides the company with a globally recognized brand as it pursues continued growth

AMSTERDAM and LONDON, Nov. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- EuroCCP , a leading pan-European clearing house and subsidiary of Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), today announced it has rebranded to Cboe Clear Europe with immediate effect.  Cboe acquired EuroCCP on 1 July 2020, bringing together two companies that have long championed competition, open access and clearing interoperability in Europe.
Under Cboe's ownership, Cboe Clear Europe has enhanced its position as the leading pan-European cash equities clearing house, by expanding the number of venues it provides clearing services to from 37 to 47, which provides it with access to approximately 95 per cent of all European equity trades. In addition to its leading position clearing for venues that allow interoperable clearing, it has also seen strong growth in preferred clearing, which is used on venues that do not support true clearing interoperability and allows Cboe Clear Europe to clear a trade provided that both counterparties have elected it as their preferred clearing provider. Cboe Clear Europe's volumes for this service were 40.5 million in the 10 months ended 31 October 2022, compared with 9.1 million in 2021, helping its clients to achieve significant transactional cost savings by allowing them to consolidate more of their pan-European equities clearing activities at a single provider.
Arnoud Siegmann, Interim President and Chief Operating Officer of Cboe Clear Europe, said: "Cboe's acquisition has already enabled a step-change in our business, and we feel now is the right time to rebrand as Cboe Clear Europe as we pursue continued growth wherever we can bring most value for our venues, members and clients. It clearly demonstrates our Cboe ownership and provides us with a globally recognized brand when it comes to the services we offer."
Cboe Clear Europe has also successfully diversified into equity derivatives clearing in support of Cboe Europe Derivatives (CEDX), Cboe's pan-European derivatives exchange which launched in September 2021. This innovative marketplace is already demonstrating its potential and Cboe Clear Europe is committed to providing CEDX's participants with meaningful cost savings by offering them the ability to clear a broad range of pan-European equity derivatives at a single clearing house.
As Cboe Clear Europe pursues continued growth and expansion of its services, it remains committed to an open-access approach by serving multiple exchanges and trading venues — helping to promote truly competitive, integrated and pan-European infrastructures for the benefit of market participants.
Natan Tiefenbrun, President of Cboe Europe, said: "We are excited to bring the Cboe name to EuroCCP and unify our European businesses from a branding perspective. Cboe Clear Europe and its team have helped to drive significant post-trade efficiencies in European equity markets and developed a reputation for exceptional levels of client service, innovation and risk management. As it takes its new name and enters its next phase of growth, those attributes — as well as a fundamental belief in open access — will continue to underpin the business to ensure participants go on reaping the benefits of a competitive clearing environment."
Cboe Clear Europe will continue to operate as an independent subsidiary of the Cboe group, retaining a separate governance structure and management team. Further information on the company and its services can be found here: clear.cboe.com/europe

Rally Japan – Day Three Report
- Hyundai Motorsport has completed the 2022 FIA World Rally Championship (WRC) with an emphatic 1-2 result at Rally Japan
- Thierry Neuville and Martijn Wydaeghe scored their second victory of the season – and the team's fifth – on a rain-affected final day, ahead of Ott Tänak and Martin Järveoja in second
- Tyre choice played an important role on the final day, as the Hyundai i20 N Rally1 crews excelled to secure the team a competitive finish.

SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 13, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Hyundai Motorsport has concluded the 2022 FIA World Rally Championship (WRC) with a 1-2 result in Rally Japan, securing the team its fifth victory of the season and the second of the year for Belgian crew Thierry Neuville and Martijn Wydaeghe.
Ott Tänak and Martin Järveoja completed the final day of the new tarmac event in second place overall to claim their eighth podium of the season – and 16 th in total since joining Hyundai Motorsport back in 2020. It represents a fitting end to the Estonian crew's three-season tenure with the squad, which draws a close with this positive result.
On the final day on the picturesque Japanese roads, crews negotiated five tricky tests in complicated conditions with rain arriving during the morning. The schedule began with the short 7.52km run through Asahi Kougen (SS15), which also acted as the season-closing Power Stage (SS19). The longest test of the day, Ena City (SS16/SS18, 21.59km) followed, with a single pass of Nenoue Plateau (SS17, 11.60km) sandwiching the two repeated stages.
Both Hyundai Motorsport crews opted to take wet weather tyres as part of their final day package, in anticipation of rain which duly came mid-morning. Neuville saw his lead initially reduced to 0.6 seconds but a stage win on the subsequent dry test, and drama for Elfyn Evans, saw the Belgian earn a comfortable one-minute advantage – now over his Estonian team-mates. From there, both crews adopted a cautious approach as the rain arrived to secure a 1-2 result.
In terms of pure statistics, the 1-2 result is an historic one for the team with many notable milestones. It is the 25 th victory for Hyundai Motorsport since joining the WRC in 2014, and with the top two positions, it scores the team its 99 th and 100 th individual podium results. Adding to the celebratory numbers, the team has also scored five wins in a single season for the first time (following success in Sardinia, Finland, Ypres, and Greece) – all in the first season with its Hyundai i20 N Rally1, a multiple rally-winner on gravel and tarmac.

ROCKVILLE,M.D. and SUZHOU, China, Nov. 13, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Innovent Biologics, Inc. ("Innovent") (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology, autoimmune, metabolic, ophthalmology and other major diseases, today presented the updated results of IBI351 (GFH925) (KRAS G12C inhibitor) from a phase Ia clinical trial (NCT05005234) at the 2022 Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) Annual Meeting.
Phase Ia study of IBI351 (GFH925) monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors: updated results
IBI351(GFH925) is a novel, irreversible covalent inhibitor of KRAS G12C mutation. The NCT05005234 study presented was a first-in-human study conducted in China to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of IBI351 monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors who failed or intolerant to standard of care treatment. As data cutoff (29 July 2022), 67 subjects were enrolled in the study, including 61 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 5 colorectal cancer(CRC) and 1 pancreatic cancer. Approximately 50% patients received 2 lines or above prior systemic anticancer therapy. 37.7% of NSCLC patients had brain metastases. The highlights of the study results were as follows:
- Of 55 evaluable NSCLC patients, 28 achieved partial response (PR), with investigator assessed ORR 50.9% and DCR 92.7%. As data cutoff, most patients remained on treatment. Sustained treatment response was observed at low dose of IBI351. Median duration of response (DOR) and median progression free survival (PFS) were not reached yet.
- Of 21 patients with NSCLC treated at 600mg BID (the recommended phase 2 dose), better efficacy signal was observed, with investigator assessed ORR 61.9%(13/21) and DCR 100%.
- Of 5 CRC patients, 3 achieved PR, with investigator assessed ORR and DCR 60%. 1 pancreatic cancer patient achieved PR in 1 st tumor assessment, and remained on treatment.
- As data cutoff, IBI351 was well tolerated. No DLT was reported and MTD was not reached. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 92.5% (62/67) patients and the most common TRAEs were anemia, transferase increased, bilirubin increased, pruritus and fatigue. The majority of the TRAEs were grade 1-2 with 19.4% (13/67) of patients reporting grade 3 or higher TRAEs. There were no grade 5 TRAEs or TRAEs led to treatment discontinuation.

Favorable safety and tolerability and promising antitumor activity of IBI351 monotherapy were observed in previously-treated advanced NSCLC, CRC and pancreatic cancer harboring KRAS G12C mutation. A single arm registrational trial of IBI351 monotherapy in previously-treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer is ongoing. More data will be presented at the future medical meeting.
Professor Yi-Long Wu from Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital,  stated: "KRAS mutation as the "undruggable" target for decades has become one of the most popular direction for clinical development recently. IBI351 is a novel, irreversible covalent inhibitor of KRAS G12C mutation, whose preliminary data of safety and efficacy was reported at 2022 ASCO. The update data shows the favorable safety and promising activity of IBI351 (GFH925) monotherapy in KRAS G12C mutated advanced solid tumor. We look forward to more positive clinical data from this study. "
Dr. Hui Zhou, Senior Vice President of Innovent,  stated: "We are pleased to present our clinical development updates at the 2022 CSCO, and that IBI351 monotherapy demonstrated encouraging efficacy and safety data in phase Ia study. A single arm registrational trial of IBI351 monotherapy in previously-treated advanced NSCLC is ongoing.  We are working to advance into late stage clinical development to explore the potential of IBI351 as monotherapy and in combo-therapy. We are actively exploring next-generation immunotherapies, hoping to benefit more cancer patients."
About IBI351/GFH925 (KRAS G12C Inhibitor)
Discovered by GenFleet Therapeutics, GFH925 (Innovent R&D code: IBI351) is a novel, orally active, potent KRAS G12C inhibitor designed to effectively target the GTP/GDP exchange, an essential step in pathway activation, by modifying the cysteine residue of KRAS G12C protein covalently and irreversibly. Preclinical cysteine selectivity studies demonstrated high selectivity of IBI351 towards G12C. Subsequently, IBI351 effectively inhibits the downstream signal pathway to induce tumor cells' apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. In September 2021, Innovent and GenFleet Therapeutics entered into an exclusive license agreement for the development and commercialization of IBI351 in China (including mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) with additional option-in rights for global development and commercialization.

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 13, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --
WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) between August 1, 2019 and July 28, 2022, both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"), of the important December 27, 2022   lead plaintiff deadline .
SO WHAT:  If you purchased U.S. Bancorp securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.
WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the U.S. Bancorp class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=9420 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than December 27, 2022 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bancorp's banking subsidiary) created sales pressure on its employees that led them to open credit cards, lines of credit, and deposit accounts without consumers' knowledge and consent; (2) since at least 2015, U.S. Bank National Association and by extension, U.S. Bancorp, was aware of such unauthorized conduct that it was violating relevant regulations and laws aimed at protecting its consumers; (3) U.S. Bancorp failed to properly monitor its employees from engaging in such unlawful conduct, detect and stop the misconduct, and identify and remediate harmed consumers; (4) all the foregoing subjected the Company to a foreseeable risk of heightened regulatory scrutiny or investigation; (5) U.S. Bancorp's revenues were in part the product of unlawful conduct and thus unsustainable; and (6) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
To join the U.S. Bancorp class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=9420 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.
No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Full text: RFT is pleased to announce, for Veterans Day, that the company is featured as the second largest "Milwaukee Area-Based Veteran-Owned Business' in the 10th issue of the 40th volume of the Milwaukee Business Journal.
BROOKFIELD, Wis., Nov. 12, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- RF Technologies® (RFT™) is pleased to be featured on the "Milwaukee Area-Based Veteran-Owned Business" list for the third year running (http://www.rft.com). Since 1987, RFT has remained a leading provider of innovative and cost-effective healthcare solutions to the hospital, senior living, hospitality, and educational markets.
Founded by Army veteran and CEO, Glen Jonas, RFT is headquartered in Brookfield, Wisconsin and has been committed to keeping people safe since 1987. Glen served in the US Army from 1953-1955 in the Combat Engineering Battalion. He was based near Heidelberg, Germany and describes his service as "the greatest two years of my life." In the years since then, Glen's passion for helping and protecting people has grown into a country-wide safety and security business.
Upon returning to civilian life, Glen began his career at various manufacturing companies. After that, Jonas spent 15 years in consulting, during which time he gained significant exposure to the hospital and senior living industries. At the time, Jonas was intrigued to learn that despite the rapidly expanding senior care market, there were few wander management solutions available. His revelations formed the idea for Code Alert, RFT's first product.
Since then, RFT has grown to offer a wide array of safety and security products and solutions. Currently RFT has 122 employees, and their commitment is steadfast on safeguarding our children, empowering our elders, and protecting our communities, together. As an innovative market leader, RFT is planning a strategy around sustainable growth and solution differentiation. The company continues to expand staff and provide professional development opportunities to align career growth for their employees, and to business initiatives. "Our employees are the heart of what makes RF Technologies capable of providing safety solutions to the world around us" Glen shares proudly.
Beyond company growth and development, RFT focuses on providing safety and is driven to be a collaborative partner that meets each customer's needs and reduces their liabilities. Their team is comprised of experts with a pro-active approach to safety who leverage their industry knowledge and real-life experience to design custom-configured solutions. Unique in their field, RFT is a single-source provider for everything from quotation, to install, service, and education.

Full text: NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 11, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC ("KSF") and KSF partner, former Attorney General of Louisiana, Charles C. Foti, Jr., remind investors that they have until December 5, 2022 to file lead plaintiff applications in a securities class action lawsuit against PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NasdaqGS: PYPL), if they purchased the Company's shares between February 3, 2021 and February 1, 2022, inclusive (the "Class Period").  This action is pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.
What You May Do If you purchased shares of PayPal and would like to discuss your legal rights and how this case might affect you and your right to recover for your economic loss, you may, without obligation or cost to you, contact KSF Managing Partner Lewis Kahn toll-free at 1-877-515-1850 or via email (lewis.kahn@ksfcounsel.com), or visit https://www.ksfcounsel.com/cases/nasdaqgs-pypl/ to learn more. If you wish to serve as a lead plaintiff in this class action, you must petition the Court by December 5, 2022 .
About the Lawsuit PayPal and certain of its executives are charged with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws. 
On February 1, 2022, the Company disclosed that its net new active accounts figure ("NNAs") was only 49 million for 2021, less than the guidance of 50 million it initially provided in February 2021 and lower than the raised guidance it reiterated just months prior, that it had identified 4.5 million accounts believed to have been illegitimately created, and that, as a result, it would change focus to increasing active user engagement rather than cash account opening incentives, which would reduce its ability to maintain growth in its NNAs.
On this news, shares of PayPal plummeted $43.23 per share, or approximately 25%, from a close of $175.80 per share on February 1, 2022 to close at $132.57 per share on February 2, 2022.
The case is Defined Benefit Plan of the Mid-Jersey Trucking Industry and Teamsters Local 701 Pension and Annuity Fund v. PayPal Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 22-cv-05864.

Full text: SGF is proud to be a Platinum Sponsor at the Cade Foundation's Family Building Gala on November 12, 2022, where Dr. Beall will be honored for her contributions to the field of reproductive medicine.
ROCKVILLE, Md., Nov. 11, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Shady Grove Fertility (SGF) supports the Tinina Q. Cade Foundation as Platinum Sponsor of its Family Building Gala on November 12, 2022, where SGF physician Stephanie Beall, M.D., Ph.D., will be honored as a Family Building Champion.
More than 250 guests will attend this year's themed event "Le Diner Bleu" to recognize new building family grant recipients in addition to honoring physicians and charities that support an improved quality of life for people struggling with infertility. The Cade Foundation strives to raise $100,000 to continue its mission of serving families battling infertility by providing necessary information and financial support.
"It is a great privilege to walk alongside patients in their family-building journeys," shares Dr. Beall. "I am honored to be recognized as a Family Building Champion by the Cade Foundation and appreciate all they do to help families overcome infertility."
Dr. Beall is board certified in obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) and reproductive endocrinology and infertility (REI). She provides patient care at SGF's Towson, Maryland location. Dr. Beall has a keen clinical interest in treating patients with diminished ovarian function and fertility preservation. Dr. Beall is passionate about working with patients coping with the stress of infertility, which she has been recognized for as the recipient of a Compassionate Doctor Award on Vitals.com. The Cade Foundation honors Dr. Beall for using her voice to testify before many state legislatures to support legislation increasing mandated fertility coverage for groups at high risk for poor outcomes.
"On behalf of the Tinina Q. Cade Foundation's Board of Trustees, it is my pleasure to celebrate Dr. Beall and the work she has done to support legislation to increase fertility coverage," shares Camille Hammond, M.D., M.P.H, and CEO of the Cade Foundation. "We applaud her advocacy for her patients as a 2022 Family Building Champion."
The Cade Foundation is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to serving the needs of families battling infertility through education, outreach, and grants that help couples pay for infertility treatment or domestic adoption. Over the past decade, through events like the Race for the Family™, Corks with Cade™, and others, SGF and the Cade Foundation have raised more than $1.5 million to fund grants for fertility treatment and adoption and to build awareness about the 1 in 8 couples struggling with infertility.

Full text: SEATTLE, Nov. 11, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) today announced that its board of directors declared a quarterly base cash dividend of $0.18 per share on the common stock of the company, payable in cash on December 16, 2022, to holders of record of such common stock as of the close of business on December 2, 2022.
In fourth quarter 2020, Weyerhaeuser implemented a "base plus variable supplemental" dividend framework. Under this framework, the company expects to supplement its quarterly base cash dividend, as appropriate, with an additional return of variable cash to achieve a targeted total annual return to shareholders of 75 to 80 percent of annual Adjusted Funds Available for Distribution (Adjusted FAD). The company has the flexibility in its capital allocation framework to return this additional cash either in the form of a supplemental dividend, which will, in general, be declared and paid annually in the first quarter based on prior year financial results, or through a combination of supplemental dividend and opportunistic share repurchase.
Adjusted FAD, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by Weyerhaeuser as net cash from operations adjusted for capital expenditures and significant non-recurring items.

- Reaffirmed 2022 operating earnings guidance range of $4.97-$5.07 per share and midpoint of $5.02; 2023 operating earnings guidance range of $5.19 to $5.39 per share
- Five-year, $40 billion capital plan emphasizes investment in wires and renewables
- Company's 10-year regulated generation plan outlines nearly 15,700 MW of renewables and energy storage to meet capacity needs, manage customer affordability and support 2045 net zero target

COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 11, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- American Electric Power (Nasdaq: AEP) will continue to invest in its regulated operations as the company builds a cleaner, more resilient energy system to benefit both customers and shareholders. The company reaffirmed its 2022 narrowed operating earnings guidance range of $4.97 to $5.07 per share with an increased midpoint of $5.02 and its 2023 guidance range of $5.19 to $5.39 per share with a projected annual operating earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%. AEP management will share the company's earnings growth strategy at the annual Edison Electric Institute Financial Conference that begins Nov. 13 in Hollywood, Florida.
Operating earnings could differ from those prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for matters such as impairments, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. AEP is unable to forecast if any of these items will occur or any amounts that may be recorded for future periods. Therefore, AEP is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for earnings guidance.
"AEP has a proven track record of exceeding earnings projections and raising our guidance while delivering reliable energy and advancing toward a clean energy future," said Julie Sloat, AEP president and chief financial officer. "We're committed to building upon this success by actively managing the business and executing our strategy to ensure we're in the best position to generate value for our customers, communities and investors."
AEP will invest nearly all capital in its regulated businesses as it de-risks and streamlines its portfolio. The company's five-year, $40 billion capital investment plan allocates $26 billion to wires and $9 billion to regulated renewables.
"Our high-growth transmission business contributes more than half of our earnings per share and provides significant opportunities to deploy capital," Sloat said. "From 2023 through 2027, we're investing $15 billion to continue constructing modern, resilient transmission infrastructure that supports the evolving needs of our customers and a clean energy economy."
The company recently announced its new target of reaching net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2045. It also adjusted its near-term carbon dioxide emission reduction target from a 2000 baseline to a 2005 baseline and upgraded its 80% reduction by 2030 target to include full Scope 1 emissions.
"We see a clear pathway to achieve our accelerated carbon reduction goal and continue to explore new technologies to close the gap," said Nicholas K. Akins, AEP chair and chief executive officer. "Over the next 10 years, our regulated generation plan outlines nearly 15,700 megawatts of long-term investment potential in renewables and energy storage to meet our capacity needs to serve our customers and support the transition to net zero. Diversifying our generation portfolio also will be key as we focus on managing affordability for our customers and reducing the impact of fuel price volatility."
AEP raised its quarterly dividend to 83 cents a share in October, an increase of 5 cents per share. The company's dividend growth is in line with its long-term growth rate and within its targeted payout ratio of 60-70%.
"This quarter marks our 450 th consecutive quarterly cash dividend, and we're pleased to continue rewarding our valued shareholders with increased returns," Akins said.
AEP expects to close on the sale of its Kentucky operations in January 2023 and is targeting completion of its unregulated contracted renewables sale in the second quarter of 2023. The company also plans to complete the review of its retail business in the first half of 2023.
American Electric Power, based in Columbus, Ohio, is powering a cleaner, brighter energy future for its customers and communities. AEP's approximately 16,700 employees operate and maintain the nation's largest electricity transmission system and more than 224,000 miles of distribution lines to safely deliver reliable and affordable power to 5.5 million regulated customers in 11 states. AEP also is one of the nation's largest electricity producers with approximately 31,000 megawatts of diverse generating capacity, including more than 7,100 megawatts of renewable energy. The company's plans include growing its renewable generation portfolio to approximately 50% of total capacity by 2032. AEP is on track to reach an 80% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 and has committed to achieving net zero by 2045. AEP is recognized consistently for its focus on sustainability, community engagement, and diversity, equity and inclusion. AEP's family of companies includes utilities AEP Ohio, AEP Texas, Appalachian Power (in Virginia and West Virginia), AEP Appalachian Power (in Tennessee), Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, and Southwestern Electric Power Company (in Arkansas, Louisiana, east Texas and the Texas Panhandle). AEP also owns AEP Energy, which provides innovative competitive energy solutions nationwide. For more information, visit aep.com.
This report made by American Electric Power and its Registrant Subsidiaries contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although AEP and each of its Registrant Subsidiaries believe that their expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, any such statements may be influenced by factors that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those projected. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changes in economic conditions, electric market demand and demographic patterns in AEP service territories; the impact of pandemics, including COVID-19, and any associated disruption of AEP's business operations due to impacts on economic or market conditions, costs of compliance with potential government regulations and employees' reactions to those regulations, electricity usage, supply chain issues, customers, service providers, vendors and suppliers; the economic impact of escalating global trade tensions including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the adoption or expansion of economic sanctions or trade restrictions; inflationary or deflationary interest rate trends; volatility in the financial markets, particularly developments affecting the availability or cost of capital to finance new capital projects and refinance existing debt; the availability and cost of funds to finance working capital and capital needs, particularly if expected sources of capital, such as proceeds from the sale of assets or subsidiaries, do not materialize, and during periods when the time lag between incurring costs and recovery is long and the costs are material; decreased demand for electricity; weather conditions, including storms and drought conditions, and AEP's ability to recover significant storm restoration costs; the cost of fuel and its transportation, the creditworthiness and performance of fuel suppliers and transporters and the cost of storing and disposing of used fuel, including coal ash and spent nuclear fuel; the availability of fuel and necessary generation capacity and the performance of generation plants; AEP's ability to recover fuel and other energy costs through regulated or competitive electric rates; the ability to transition from fossil generation and the ability to build or acquire renewable generation, transmission lines and facilities (including the ability to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals and permits) when needed at acceptable prices and terms, including favorable tax treatment, and to recover those costs; new legislation, litigation and government regulation, including changes to tax laws and regulations, oversight of nuclear generation, energy commodity trading and new or heightened requirements for reduced emissions of sulfur, nitrogen, mercury, carbon, soot or particulate matter and other substances that could impact the continued operation, cost recovery, and/or profitability of AEP's generation plants and related assets; the risks associated with fuels used before, during and after the generation of electricity, including coal ash and nuclear fuel; timing and resolution of pending and future rate cases, negotiations and other regulatory decisions, including rate or other recovery of new investments in generation, distribution and transmission service and environmental compliance; resolution of litigation; AEP's ability to constrain operation and maintenance costs; prices and demand for power generated and sold at wholesale; changes in technology, particularly with respect to energy storage and new, developing, alternative or distributed sources of generation; AEP's ability to recover through rates any remaining unrecovered investment in generation units that may be retired before the end of their previously projected useful lives; volatility and changes in markets for coal and other energy-related commodities, particularly changes in the price of natural gas; changes in utility regulation and the allocation of costs within regional transmission organizations, including ERCOT, PJM and SPP; changes in the creditworthiness of the counterparties with contractual arrangements, including participants in the energy trading market; actions of rating agencies, including changes in the ratings of debt; the impact of volatility in the capital markets on the value of the investments held by AEP's pension, other postretirement benefit plans, captive insurance entity and nuclear decommissioning trust and the impact of such volatility on future funding requirements; accounting standards periodically issued by accounting standard-setting bodies; other risks and unforeseen events, including wars and military conflicts, the effects of terrorism (including increased security costs), embargoes, naturally occurring and human-caused fires, cyber security threats and other catastrophic events; and the ability to attract and retain the requisite work force and key personnel.

Full text: With a Three-Year Revenue Growth of 275 Percent, Chronic Care Staffing Receives Ranking No. 31 Among South Carolina's Fastest-Growing Private and Public Companies
CHARLESTON, S.C. , Nov. 11, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Chronic Care Staffing, LLC ("CCS"), a leading outsourced provider of clinically-based virtual care management services, has been recognized by The South Carolina Business Awards as one of the fastest-growing companies in the Palmetto State. Chronic Care Staffing ranks number 31 on the SC 50 Fastest Growing Companies list with three-year revenue growth of 275%.
Requirements for consideration include a South Carolina headquarters, three full fiscal years of operation, and revenues of at least $3 million in the most recent reported year. Members of the sponsoring organizations (including The Capital Corporation, Integrated Media Publishing, Quality Business Systems, and PNC Bank) also make site visits to the nominees to meet with company executives.
Patient Focus
CCS was founded in 2015, coinciding with the launch of CMS' Chronic Care Management initiative. CCS created a nationwide clinical delivery model that focuses on the remote delivery of high-quality patient care. CCS's Care Coordinators develop a strong rapport with their patients and can more quickly address and document changes in the patient's condition between office visits. Notes are documented in real-time, improving communication and insight to help with the management of elevated risk, chronically ill patients. This model has proven to help improve outcomes and quality measures. Examples include fewer patient A1Cs, improved medication compliance, an increased focus on the social determinants of health, and reduced ER visits, as well as decreased hospital readmissions.
Physician Focus
Programs such as CCM, Annual Wellness Visits, and Transitional Care Management are the foundations for maximizing value-based reimbursement. Healthcare providers who partner with CCS not only realize meaningful direct reimbursement from these services but also in other areas such as increased ACO Shared Savings and downstream revenue. CCS leverages its network of nurses to scale up programs to meet its clients' needs without requiring any upfront investment, which National Sales Director Patrick Dowd says, "is a win-win for clients and their patients."
Partnership Based Approach
CCS's growth is a direct reflection of the quality of its client partnerships. CCS has been fortunate to partner with successful Federally Qualified Health Centers, Hospital Systems, Private Practices, and Specialists across the country. Many clients partner with CCS initially to implement and manage CCM programs and subsequently expand the relationship to include other services designed to improve patient care. "We view all of our client relationships as long-term partnerships," says COO Connor Danielowski. "CCS certainly wouldn't be where it is today without the strong relationships we have with our clients."
Nursing Excellence
From the start, CCS invested in its recruiting and credentialing teams to ensure only the highest-caliber clinicians work on behalf of its clients. "It is not easy to be a part of CCS's clinical team," says CEO Cas Danielowski. "Our clinical leadership team and Care Coordinators are our biggest strengths."
A Win for the Home Team
Having also recently earned a ranking on the 2022 Inc. 5000 list of superior-growth companies nationwide, the Chronic Care Staffing team finds special significance in being recognized as one of "the Palmetto State's 50 most dynamic and successful companies that have contributed significantly to South Carolina's economy through exceptional increases in revenues and employment."
Celebrating Past Growth, Looking Forward
The South Carolina 50 Fastest Growing Companies designation also offers the management team of Chronic Care Staffing an opportunity to reflect – and maintain perspective. "CCS being recognized for outstanding growth is gratifying," Cas Danielowski explains. "But the goal of growth was always secondary to our mission, which is to provide a much-needed service to the patient and the provider and to do it better than anybody else. We have done that and growth has been our reward. Now, with an established footprint of clients in South Carolina and nationwide, we will continue to look for new and better ways to serve our clients and their patients with outsourced staffing programs. With that unwavering focus on service, we are confident that our growth will continue."
About Chronic Care Staffing
Chronic Care Staffing collaborates nationwide with clients ranging from small practices to large health systems. CCS is a sister company of Joint Commission-certified Millenia Medical Staffing and has access to a network of nurses across the United States. CCS is a clinically-based company that does not sell software – all our programs are designed to generate income for our clients without an upfront investment.

NEW YORK, Nov. 11, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The shopping experts at BGR DEALS have a list of all the early Black Friday trends and deals this year. Based on hours of research, we have been tracking the products and stores that have the most interest, and the best deals to shop now and on Black Friday.
This year, here's what trends we're predicting :
- Deals start earlier — it's no longer only Black Friday or Cyber Monday, but deals starting weeks leading up to the shopping events.
- TV's are going to have major deals this year.
- Foot traffic to stores is estimated to be up 65% over a regular November weekend day, according to Google.
- If you're specifically looking for Smart TVs, deals and offers could exceed 60% off on some of the top brand's models.
- Since retailers have way too much inventory, especially in the furniture and patio & lawn categories, expect sensational deals and offers.

For TVs, here are the best early Black Friday TV deals available now from Best Buy , Walmart , Amazon , and more. These Black Friday sales offer savings of up to 60% off Samsung TVs, LG OLED TVs, Amazon Fire TVs, 4K TVs, Roku TVs.

New TV sales are added daily, so we recommend searching for additional deals. BGR DEALS may earn an affiliate commission from purchases made through the provided links.
Buying advice for Black Friday sales : We can take some guesses as to what is going to be on sale this year.
The biggest discounts are likely to come on older versions of equipment that may have received an upgrade this year.
New Apple devices, Amazon devices, laptops, desktops, tablets, headphones, and toys may see slight discounts.
But their previous versions are likely going to be more heavily discounted. Last year, a lot of stores were dealing with supply chain issues and shipping delays, so they started their sales earlier. Some of them began Black Friday deals in October.
We expect that might be the case again this year, as customers really enjoyed being able to do holiday shopping early and shopping for Black Friday deals earlier. We also saw during last year's sale that items like the Nintendo Switch OLED were brand new and Bose QuietComfort 45 had just come out. While they may have not been discounted much last year, for the Black Friday deals 2022, that could change.

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 11, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --
WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds investors who: (a) exchanged Discovery, Inc. ("Discovery") common stock (NASDAQ: DISCA, DISCB, DISCK) for Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. ("Warner Bros.") common stock (NASDAQ: WBD) pursuant to Discovery's February 4, 2022 Registration Statement on Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 10, 2022; and/or (b) purchased shares of Warner Bros. common stock on the open market traceable to the Prospectus through the date of the filing of the complaint on September 23, 2022 of the important November 22, 2022   lead plaintiff deadline .
SO WHAT:  If you exchanged Discovery common stock for Warner Bros. common stock pursuant to Discovery's February 4, 2022 Registration Statement on Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus filed with the SEC on February 10, 2022 and/or purchased shares of Warner Bros. common stock on the open market traceable to the Prospectus through September 23, 2022, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.
WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Warner Bros. Discovery class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=8888 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than November 22, 2022 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, at the time of filing the Registration Statement and Prospectus, defendants either knew or had access to adverse information concerning operations of the WarnerMedia business of AT&T. Among other things, as subsequently disclosed by defendants after the merger: (1) WarnerMedia's HBO Max streaming business had a high churn rate that made the business not "viable" unless the churn rate was reversed; (2) AT&T was overinvesting in WarnerMedia entertainment content for streaming, without sufficient concern for return on investments; (3) WarnerMedia had a business model to grow the number of subscribers to its streaming service without regard to cost or profitability; (4) WarnerMedia was improvidently concentrating its investments in streaming and ignoring its other business lines; and (5) WarnerMedia had overstated the number of subscribers to HBO Max by as many as 10 million subscribers, by including as subscribers AT&T customers who had received bundled access to HBO Max, but had not signed onto the service. The adverse information was not disclosed to Discovery shareholders in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or otherwise prior to the effective date of the merger. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
To join the Warner Bros. Discovery class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=8888 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.
No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Full text: Lab 1 contextualises compromised and exposed data from the Open, Deep and Dark Web; helping businesses quantify and act on hidden threats & risks across their global supply chains.
LONDON , Nov. 11, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Cyber intelligence platform Lab 1 (https://lab-1.io) today announced a £1m funding round supported by MMC Ventures Co-Founder & Chairman and investor Alan Morgan, alongside MMC Ventures, prominent investor Cris Conde and SyndicateRoom's Access EIS Fund.
After three years of development and data research, Lab 1 is launching the world's first contextual knowledge graph of data breaches to help companies quantify cybersecurity risk and exposure across their entire global supply chain. The funding will be used to accelerate product engineering and growth.
Lab 1 discovers, quantifies and contextualises for its clients criminal activity on forums, messaging platforms, file sharing sites, code repositories, the dark web and many other sources. The company's CiGraph has already amassed over 24bn data entities in a global database of compromised and exposed data.
CiGraph transforms breach data into feeds and reports on any company, including insight timelines, types and sources of stolen data. It uses algorithms to calculate the impact and risk that a breach poses to each company.
"Lab 1 is the first cyber intelligence platform of its kind to contextualise the network effect of breaches", said Lab1 CEO and co-founder Robin Brattel. "Breaches affect trust, costs, even stock performance. We know the problem is enormous because we are collecting an average of 626 breached data entities per second. Lab 1 can help companies build cyber resilient supply chains, and are delighted that leading investors are backing us."
MMC Co-Founder & Chairman and investor Alan Morgan explained the investment opportunity: "Misuse of data and criminal activity affect every part of the supply chain and create risks to corporate performance and reputation. The potential for Lab 1 is compelling: Lab1 tools strengthen cybersecurity across the entire supply chain and make companies more robust."
Cris Conde added, "If I were still in my former Fortune 500 CEO role, I would have been an early adopter of Lab 1 so that I could get such updates on my phone for all of my top vendors. Systemically-important companies have outsourced processes and use software from thousands of providers. The client is left in the dark as to potential cyber exposures at the vendor, or if there have been changes in the threat surface of the vendor. That's why Lab 1 fills such an important void."
To make it easy for security teams to turn breach information into action, Lab 1 offers Blast, a real-time alerting service; Radius, a detailed breach incident report, and Fallout, an analysis of the compromised data, including impact assessment combining multiple different data sets to unearth hidden threats and risks. Company Reports present a connected view of all information.
Lab 1 already counts a Five Eyes defence force as client and a data partnership with US-based supplier intelligence company Craft. To set up Lab 1, enterprise customers only need the company names they wish to monitor, and Lab 1 will start delivering insights in near real-time via email, UI and API.

Full text: STOCKHOLM, Nov. 11, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Oncopeptides AB (publ) (Nasdaq Stockholm: ONCO), a biotech company focused on research and development of therapies for difficult-to-treat hematological diseases, today announces that Pepaxti ® (melphalan flufenamide, also called melflufen) has been granted marketing authorization in combination with dexamethasone, by the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, MHRA, in UK.
"The approval of Pepaxti in UK is one additional important milestone for Oncopeptides that further validates our science and data," says Jakob Lindberg, CEO Oncopeptides AB. "Pepaxti provides clinical benefit to patients with triple class refractory disease. This is very good news for patients with multiple myeloma, whose treatment options ultimately become exhausted." 
The marketing authorization in the UK is based on data from the phase 2 HORIZON study and is supported by data from the randomized controlled phase 3 OCEAN study as a confirmatory study.
The clinical benefit of melflufen in multiple myeloma patients with a treatment history with no stem-cell transplant or a successful prior stem-cell transplant has recently gained additional support with data from the phase 3 LIGHTHOUSE study.
Pepaxti is indicated, in combination with dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapies, whose disease is refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory agent, and one anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who have demonstrated disease progression on or after the last therapy. For patients with a prior autologous stem cell transplantation, the time to progression should be at least 3 years from transplantation.
On August 18, Pepaxti was granted marketing authorization by the European Commission in EU and in the EEA-countries Iceland, Lichtenstein, and Norway.
Multiple myeloma is an incurable disease that mainly affects people over 65 years of age. Data from Cancer Research UK (Cancer Research UK, 2010) and the Global Cancer Observatory (Globocan, 2020) states that the estimated prevalence of multiple myeloma is around 17.600 patients. There are around 6.000 new cases diagnosed every year.
Oncopeptides is currently assessing the market access opportunities for Pepaxti in the UK.

The information in the press release is information that Oncopeptides is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation. The information was submitted for publication, through the agency of the contact person above, on November 11, 2022, at 17:15 (CET).
About Pepaxti 
Pepaxti (melphalan flufenamide, also called melflufen) is a lipophilic peptide conjugated alkylating drug that rapidly and selectively is delivering cytotoxic agents into tumor cells. The drug is composed of a di-peptide and an alkylating moiety. The lipophilicity allows a faster cellular uptake whereas the peptide hydrolysis mediated by aminopeptidases, results in accumulation of alkylating moieties in cancer cells. This results in an improved efficacy without an increased toxicity compared to melphalan. Pepaxti inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of haematopoietic and solid tumour cells. It shows synergistic cytotoxicity in combination with dexamethasone in melphalan resistant and non-resistant multiple myeloma cell lines.  
Pepaxti is indicated in combination with dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapy, whose disease is refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory agent, and one anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who have demonstrated disease progression on or after the last therapies. For patients with a prior autologous stem cell transplantation, the time to progression should be at least 3 years from transplantation. 
About Oncopeptides
Oncopeptides is a global biotech company focused on research and development of therapies for difficult-to-treat hematological diseases. The company uses its proprietary Peptide Drug Candidate platform, PDC, to develop compounds that rapidly and selectively deliver cytotoxic agents into cancer cells. On August 18, 2022, the European Commission granted Pepaxti ®  (melphalan flufenamide, also called melflufen) Marketing Authorization in the European Union and countries in the European Economic Area, in combination with dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapies, whose disease is refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory agent, and one anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who have demonstrated disease progression on or after the last therapy. For patients with a prior autologous stem cell transplantation, the time to progression should be at least 3 years from transplantation.
Oncopeptides is developing several new compounds based on its technology platforms. The company is built on a Swedish innovation and is listed in the Mid Cap segment on Nasdaq Stockholm with the ticker ONCO. More information is available on www.oncopeptides.com.

Full text: Syncron will sponsor and participate in the 2022 AEM annual conference in Napa, Calif., connecting with service organizations in the equipment manufacturing industry. 
ATLANTA, Nov. 11, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Syncron today announced its sponsorship and participation in the following upcoming conference in November 2022:
2022 AEM Annual Conference: Braving the Elements
Hosted by the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM)
November 16 – 18, 2022
The Meritage Resort and Spa, Napa, Calif.
The AEM annual conference is an opportunity for service leaders to connect and explore the future of the equipment manufacturing industry. Expert-led education and events help service organizations adapt and prepare for future growth. Service leaders will have the opportunity to network and engage in direct conversation with suppliers, peers, and subject matter experts to help them explore and navigate the equipment manufacturing industry's unique challenges.
Participants will also gain valuable industry perspectives through a full schedule of insightful breakout sessions, small group roundtable discussions, and candid conversations with industry leaders shaping the equipment manufacturing industry. Scheduled discussion topics range from sustainability to corporate responsibility and leadership.
Sustainability is at the forefront of many corporate agendas, and the right enablement solutions can align these priorities with future growth. By connecting service level and cost analysis with carbon emissions from logistics methods, service leaders can align operational and sustainability improvements with achieving higher profitability.
"Sustainability is a global priority at its core, with leaders of countries and companies driving toward the same outcome of reducing carbon emissions," said Justin Konopaske, director of industry solutions, Syncron. "While sustainability is sometimes viewed as an additional cost or change, the right enablement solutions allow service organizations to operationalize sustainability and simultaneously increase profitability."
Supporting its participation at the AEM annual conference, Syncron recently announced a technician enablement initiative driven by their Parts Catalog and Service Knowledge solutions. Together, these components provide an on-demand, comprehensive knowledge base and troubleshooting platform that empowers field service technicians to increase productivity, reduces wasted parts to align with sustainability initiatives, and optimizes customer satisfaction.

Full text: The ultimate Base/Liner for your dental restoration. Bio-LCB provides superior strength, bonds to dentin, and promotes dentin remineralization.
SOUTH HACKENSACK, N.J., Nov. 11, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Bio-LCB™ - Light Cured Base and Liner
Bio-LCB was developed as a shock-absorbing protective base/liner under composites, amalgams, and other cement materials. Unlike other bases/liners, Bio-LCB provides superior strength, bonds to dentin, and promotes dentin remineralization. The proprietary UDMA-based formulation forms calcium hydroxide upon curing which results in an increase in pH. This action protects the pulp, stimulating pulpal cells to form dentin and decreases the risk of secondary decay. This unique composition also contains remineralizing agents which are released upon setting to form hydroxyapatite and further aid in the remineralization of the surrounding dentition.
Advanced Features Include:
- Bonds to dentin to prevent bacterial leakage and secondary decay
- Promotes reparative dentin remineralization
- Strong mechanical shock absorbing protection - bonds to dentin and restorative materials
- Low polymerization shrinkage
- Pulp protection and sensitivity reduction
- Hydrophilic
- Radiopaque

Pricing and Availability Bio-LCB Light Cured Base and Liner is available now as a Starter Pack with two syringes (2g ea.) and 8 tips for a suggested retail price of $37.50 or as an Economy Pack with four syringes (2g ea.) and 16 tips for a suggested retail price of $71.60. Bio-LCB, and all EDS products are available via dental distributors. To order or for more information contact EDS at 201-487-9090 or visit http://edsdental.com/Bio-LCB/

ST. LOUIS, Nov. 11, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- In observance of Veterans Day, Enterprise Rent-A-Car is again joining Progressive Insurance ® to support the insurance company's annual Keys to Progress ® program. In honor of the 10 th vehicle giveaway, more than 100 veterans and military-related organizations across all 50 states received newly refurbished vehicles at nationwide giveaway events this week.
Since the program was established in 2013, Keys to Progress ®  has donated more than 900 vehicles to veterans and veteran organizations. Enterprise Rent-A-Car is once again providing six months of auto insurance coverage to each vehicle recipient. Vehicles distributed through this year's Keys to Progress ®  giveaway were purchased by Progressive from Enterprise's U.S. fleet.
"The Keys to Progress ® program is an important opportunity to give back to individuals who have sacrificed for our country," said Mary Mahoney, vice president of the replacement and leisure division at Enterprise Holdings, the company that owns and operates the Enterprise Rent-A-Car brand. "By providing six months of auto insurance coverage to vehicle recipients, we hope to help bring peace of mind to veterans in need, as a small token of our appreciation for their service."
Progressive partners with several organizations to make Keys to Progress ®  a success, including Veracity Research Co. Investigations, Insurance Auto Auctions, Inc., 1-800-Charity Cars and several local military charities.
Commitment to Military Support Enterprise's rich military heritage goes back more than six decades when Jack Taylor founded the company and named it after the USS Enterprise, one of the aircraft carriers he served on as a U.S. Navy pilot during World War II. Jack's service and lessons learned during the war are shared in the documentary, Jack Taylor: The Enterprise, released this month, and airing on local PBS stations throughout November.  
Today, Enterprise continues its support of the military in three key areas – recruitment and hiring, local operations and community relations. Military veterans and members of the guard and reserves currently make up 8% of Enterprise's total U.S. workforce, including those at the military installations Enterprise serves around the globe.
"This initiative is incredibly special to us. Keys to Progress ® represents two of the values that are of the utmost importance to our company – supporting our communities and giving back to veterans and members of the military," said Will Withington, senior vice president of North American operations at Enterprise Holdings. "It's an honor to be part of this nationwide effort to recognize veterans throughout our communities."
Fisher House Foundation Enterprise's support of veterans extends to our partnership with Fisher House Foundation, a nonprofit organization that provides no-cost lodging to the families of veterans receiving treatment at military medical centers.
In 2015, the Enterprise Rent-A-Car Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the Enterprise Rent-A-Car brand, launched a three-year, $3 million commitment to the Fisher House Foundation. The Foundation renewed this commitment in 2017 and again in 2020, for a total of $9 million in support to the Fisher House Foundation.
Each year, $750,000 is earmarked for the Heroes' Legacy Scholarship program, which is open to the dependent, unmarried children, under age 23, of those who have fallen in battle and those who have died or have become disabled through their active military service since Sept. 11, 2001. The remaining $250,000 is allocated for building homes on the grounds of major military and Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers.

Full text: Board Certified Orthopedic Surgeon, Dr. James W. Cahill has been reviewed and approved by NJ Top Docs for 2022.
SCOTCH PLAINS, N.J., Nov. 11, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Dr. James W. Cahill has been reviewed and approved by NJ Top Docs for 2022. He is Fellowship Trained in Adult and Pediatric Sports Medicine and Reconstruction. Using his expertise, Dr. Cahill specializes in sports injuries and joint replacements.
Dr. James Cahill is a board-certified orthopedic surgeon, whose private practice is proudly affiliated with Hackensack University Medical Center in Hackensack, New Jersey. Dr. Cahill also has surgical privileges at the Valley Hospital in Ridgewood as well as Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck.
Dr. Cahill routinely performs arthroscopic and joint replacement surgery of the shoulders, elbow, hip and knee. He also has incorporated robotic surgical techniques for his partial knee, total knee and total hip patients.
His medical interests include joint replacements, arthroscopic shoulder and knee ligament repair/reconstructive surgery as well as treatment of cartilage injuries.
"My initial approach to most injuries is a non-operative attempt to avoid surgery when possible. When surgical treatment is necessary, current reconstructive techniques can return patients to a full level of activity. Over the past five years, surgical techniques have advanced considerably. We are able to achieve excellent levels of success in patient satisfaction. We are also much better in controlling the discomfort often associated with surgical treatment specifically, joint replacement surgery," says Dr. Cahill.
Additionally, Dr. Cahill has lectured on and participated in original research for the treatment of cartilage injuries that ultimately require cartilage repair and reconstruction.

Full text: Recent release "The Dark Tomb" from Page Publishing author K.L. Dempsey is a riveting novel introducing Jake Nelson, a private detective whose encounter with an impossibly elderly woman from his past sets him on a collision course with his own demons and a stunning revelation.
ALSIP, Ill., November 11, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- K.L. Dempsey, a Detroit native and US Army veteran who worked in marketing and sales for the aviation industry before taking early retirement and presently makes his home in a suburb of Chicago, Illinois, has completed his new book "The Dark Tomb": a gripping and potent thriller that keeps the pages turning until its dramatic conclusion.
"The Dark Tomb" is K. L. Dempsey's seventh thriller in less than three years and proof that he's fast becoming a recognized master of this particular style of mystery.
Jake Nelson, the current owner of the Warren Detective Agency located in Warren, Michigan, watched in disbelief as the old woman walked out of the woods while he had been vacation-fishing in Minnesota. It had been more than a shock to see her since this sighting would not have been possible unless she somehow had beaten her expiration date on earth. At the time of their first meeting, he had been twenty-seven years old, working for Eastern Airlines, and she eighty-six when she had joined him and a group of other travel agents on an airline-sponsored familiarization trip to New Orleans. Propulsive as a jolt of adrenaline, "The Dark Tomb" features a storyline that deals with finding out how this sighting could have been possible and the reasons why it is happening now. As the investigation deepens, Nelson calls upon one of the new employees that had just joined the firm to help him solve this mystery and at the same time force him to face his own demons.

Full text: Legendary Jazz Supergroup THE COOKERS include NEA Jazz Master & Acclaimed Tenor Saxophonist BILLY HARPER, NEA Jazz Master & GRAMMY® Award Nominated Drummer BILLY HART, GRAMMY® Award-Winning Bassist CECIL MCBEE, NEA Jazz Master & GRAMMY® Award Nominated Alto Saxophonist DONALD HARRISON, as well as Pianist GEORGE CABLES, Trumpeter EDDIE HENDERSON, and Trumpeter DAVID WEISS. Tickets for THE COOKERS at Jimmy's Jazz & Blues Club, as well as the current list of 2022 & 2023 shows, can be found on Ticketmaster.com and Jimmy's Online Event Calendar at: http://www.jimmysoncongress.com/events.
PORTSMOUTH, N.H., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Jimmy's Jazz & Blues Club Features Legendary Jazz Supergroup THE COOKERS on Friday and Saturday November 25 & 26 at 7:30 P.M. The BOSTON GLOBE raves, "Player for player, there's no better working band in jazz than The Cookers."
"Player for player, there's no better working band in jazz than The Cookers." Experience counts, especially in jazz. You can hear the fruits of such work in the expressive language THE COOKERS bring to the bandstand and to their six critically acclaimed recordings. This legendary and exciting all-star septet summons up an aggressive mid '60s spirit with a potent collection of expansive post-bop originals marked by all the requisite killer instincts and pyrotechnic playing expected of some of the heaviest hitters on the scene today.
"A dream team of forward-leaning hard-bop"
— NEW YORK TIMES
"(The Cookers) are some of the best composers, arrangers and musicians we have in jazz, and they're working together in one of the most exciting super-groups we've seen in a long, long time. The arrangements, handled by Harper and Weiss, are outrageously wonderful. And the musicians just kill it on every tune."
— DOWNBEAT MAGAZINE
"These legends play a vivacious strain of muscular acoustic jazz that establishes a historical through-line to the innovations of past masters, keeping the faith with passion and grace."
— ALL ABOUT JAZZ
"If you wondered what has happened to all the passion and intensity, once such essential ingredients of great swinging jazz and now virtually non-existent in so much of today's outpourings, you'll find it all in The Cookers."
— JAZZWISE
BILLY HARPER (Tenor Saxophone), CECIL MCBEE (Bass), GEORGE CABLES (Piano), EDDIE HENDERSON (Trumpet), and BILLY HART (Drums) all came up in the heady era of the mid '60s. It was a period that found the dimensions of hard bop morphing from their original designs, and each of these guys helped facilitate the process as members of some of the most important bands of the era. DAVID WEISS (Trumpet) and DONALD HARRISON (Alto Sax), the youngest members of this talented band, are from a more recent generation.
Billy Hart and Eddie Henderson were members of Herbie Hancock's groundbreaking Mwandishi group; Cecil McBee anchored Charles Lloyd's great '60s quartet alongside Keith Jarrett and Jack DeJohnette; Billy Harper was part of Lee Morgan's last group, as well as being a member of Max Roach's Quartet and Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers; while George Cables held down the piano chair in numerous bands including groups led by Sonny Rollins, Joe Henderson, Freddie Hubbard, Dexter Gordon and Art Pepper.
David Weiss and Donald Harrison are experts in this forthright lingo, having gained experience performing with Art Blakey, Bobby Hutcherson, Freddie Hubbard, Charles Tolliver, Roy Haynes and Herbie Hancock.
THE COOKERS, who "embody the serious-as-death commitment that it took to thrive on the New York scene some four decades ago" (The Boston Globe), released their sixth acclaimed album, Look Out! in 2021. On Look Out! the incredibly high level of musicianship has only increased with fresh, challenging, boundary-pushing music from these revered veteran improvisers.
Each member of THE COOKERS has also spent time leading his own series of groups, and each has a keenly individual sound. But it's the unmistakable power of teamwork that makes this music so commanding and resonates with a kind of depth and beauty that speaks of the seasoned track record of its principals (combined, the group has over 250 years of experience in the jazz world and has been a part of over 1,000 recordings). You can feel the collective weight of that experience in their music, and especially in their live performances.
THE COOKERS Tickets & Current Schedule of Shows
Jimmy's Jazz & Blues Club's 2022 Schedule of Shows now includes 9 NEA Jazz Masters, 52 GRAMMY® Award-Winning Artists, 46 Blues Music Award-Winners, and a comprehensive list of talented musicians with 575+ GRAMMY® Award Nominations amongst them.

Full text: SFBU Professor Ahmed Banafa, in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, outlines the risks and benefits of implanted microchips
FREMONT, Calif., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Robocop, Star Wars, and Iron Man are all blockbuster examples of humans enhancing themselves through mechanical means. In reality, the application of the same principles is happening now through RFID (radio-frequency identification) chips in humans. These chips are incredibly small - about the size of a grain of rice - and can store information such as medical records or access to buildings and devices.
Professor Ahmed Banafa, an engineering professor at San Francisco Bay University, recently wrote a paper on the topic in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.
Professor Banafa states, "At first glance, such consumer technology looks like a harmless whim, or the next logical step among those who favor piercings, or the supposed ultimate in convenience. But inserting identification microchips in humans would also seem to bear the seeds of a particularly intrusive form of surveillance, at a time when authorities in some parts of the world have been forcibly collecting DNA and other biological data – including blood samples, fingerprints, voice recordings, iris scans, and other unique identifiers – from all their citizens."
Professor Banafa teaches not only the technical side of human enhancement but also discusses the ethics and, ultimately, the  why  with his students. It's important to understand all of the implications of microchip implants, their humanity-changing benefits, and the potentially disastrous consequences.
For more information about the topic or to interview San Francisco Bay University engineering Professor Banafa, please contact pr@sfbu.edu.

Full text: Jihyung Nam, +82-70 7725 0593
- First patient expected in December 2022
SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- J INTS BIO announced on November 9 th that it had received approval from the US FDA for its Phase 1/2 clinical trial of its Novel Oral 4th Generation EGFR TKI 'JIN-A02' in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
IND submission is currently ongoing sequentially in territories outside of USA.
'JIN-A02' is a Novel Orally administered 4th Generation EGFR TKI, which is highly selective and potent against NSCLC harboring C797S double or triple mutations, presenting in either cis or trans forms. Cis isomer is the most common and currently untreatable. 'JIN-A02' also has high blood-brain barrier penetrance with demonstrated in-vivo efficacy.
J INTS BIO is expecting the first patient to be recruited in the US before the end of the year.
About J INTS BIO
J INTS BIO is a bio company specialized in developing innovative anti-cancer and orphan drugs to realize the goal of changing lives and improving health for patients around the world. J INTS BIO's teams have prior multi-year experience in multinational pharmaceutical companies and CROs and track records in medical, regulatory affairs, drug discovery and development.
About 'JIN-A02'
'JIN-A02' is a novel orally administered 4th Generation EGFR TKI targeting C797S mutations in NSCLC. Although 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Generation EGFR TKIs have been used with some success, recurrence occurs in most patients including those on 3rd Generation TKIs such as Osimertinib. Currently, there are no approved therapies for patients who developed EGFR C797S mutations due to the use of 3rd Generation EGFR TKIs and with the high propensity of these cancers to metastasize to the brain, there is an urgent need to develop an effective drug with high blood-brain barrier permeability as well. 'JIN-A02', a novel oral EGFR TKI, which is effective against C797S double and triple mutations and have a high brain penetrance, is therefore expected to become the most promising Best-in-Class 4th-generation EGFR TKI in NSCLC patients with limited or no viable treatment options.

Disney has always used new technology to enable world-class storytelling and to help redefine and advance entertainment. As the company focuses on its next-generation storytelling efforts, Disney will continue to explore how these types of new canvasses and techniques can help create connected experiences across physical, digital and virtual worlds.
"For nearly one hundred years, Disney has embraced cutting edge technology to remain at the forefront of creative storytelling and deliver the most innovative entertainment experiences for audiences and guests around the world," said Bonnie Rosen, General Manager of the Disney Accelerator program. "This commitment to advancement is also an integral part of the Disney Accelerator, which allows us to collaborate with outstanding growth stage companies like those in this year's class that share our desire to redefine the media landscape. We hope that Demo Day is just the beginning of our relationship with these companies, and we can't wait to see the amazing things we could build together for Disney fans."
The 2022 Disney Accelerator companies include:
Flickplay : Flickplay is a Web3 social app that enables users to discover digital collectibles tied to real-world locations that they can experience and share via AR. Flickplay is in conversations with Disney Consumer Products, Games and Publishing (CPGP) to create and deliver digital collectible activations within physical locations across the Unites States.
Inworld AI : Inworld allows users to create interactive, AI-driven characters for immersive experiences. Today, Inworld announced that it is in conversations with ILMxLAB, Lucasfilm's immersive storytelling studio, to build developer tools for creating characters at scale in immersive worlds. Additionally, Inworld is exploring the development of an AI personality for Disney Star's DisneyStarverse platform. At today's Demo Day, Inworld demonstrated a 'Droid Maker' prototype that the company created in collaboration with ILMxLAB.
Lockerverse : Lockerverse is a community platform that empowers creators and brands to tell culture-defining stories and deliver unique access and experiences. Lockerverse is working with ESPN to launch a free NFT of the Celebration Bowl Trophy, to be exclusively first offered at the Celebration Bowl on December 17 in Atlanta.
Obsess : Obsess is an experiential e-commerce platform that enables brands to create immersive 3D virtual stores on their websites and on Web3 platforms. In early October, Obsess launched the Disney Music Emporium virtual experience, an immersive online store celebrating the wonder of Disney music. Obsess is also in conversations with Disneyland Resort and shopDisney to create a special retail experience.
Polygon : Polygon is a business layer for blockchain technology that allows developers and enterprises to build Web3 experiences. Polygon is working with Disney on developing a proof of concept for exclusive digital collectibles to recognize Disney employees during special occasions.
Red 6 : Red 6 is an AR company that has created a patented headset and interface that works outdoors in dynamic, high-performance environments. Walt Disney Imagineering and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) are exploring opportunities to bring this technology into our story-driven environments for next generation experiences of the future.
Following today's presentations, the Disney Accelerator brought Web3 to life on the Walt Disney Studios lot for attendees by showcasing exclusive demonstrations from the 2021 and 2022 Disney Accelerator companies, including life-sized versions of Disney's most popular NFTs and a special Flickplay scavenger hunt that allowed attendees to find and interact with Disney digital collectibles.
For the first time, the previous year's Disney Accelerator companies attended Demo Day and showcased their technologies and recent collaborations with The Walt Disney Company for guests. Those companies included:
Attentive : Attentive is a comprehensive mobile messaging platform that allows retail and e-commerce brands to connect directly with consumers through personalized communication experiences. This summer, Attentive launched an opt-in experience to provide Disney guests a seamless opportunity to communicate with Disney Theatrical Productions via SMS and email through www.aladdinthemusical.com.

These immersive and interactive collaborations travel to other CAMP locations every few months.

ABOUT SOUL TRAIN
"Soul Train" was created in 1971 by visionary Don Cornelius and predominantly featured performances by R&B, pop, soul, and hip-hop artists, in addition to the occasional funk, jazz, disco, and gospel artists. When the final episode of the show's historic thirty-five-year run aired in 2006, it was the longest-running first-run, nationally syndicated program in television history. "Soul Train" highlighted a cast of incredible, ethnically diverse dancers who famously introduced the world to a whole new series of dance moves and styles on a weekly basis. Cornelius opened every show welcoming the audience to "the hippest trip in America" and closed each show wishing the audience "love, peace, and soul." Today, the legacy of "Soul Train" lives on through the legendary Soul Train dance line, which has become a timeless staple on dance floors across America. In 2016, BET, acquired the "Soul Train" brand and remains dedicated to revitalizing the brand while also honoring its heritage.

Kellogg Company SVP, Global Chief Information Officer, Lesley Salmon, recently shared 4 tips on building a positive company culture
BATTLE CREEK, Mich., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- On average, a person will spend one-third of their time at work over a lifetime. That's far too much time to do something you don't love.
As Global CIO at Kellogg Company, I think a lot about how to keep my team engaged, growing, and delivering the best results for our stakeholders – both internally and externally. My worst nightmare is to have people on my team thinking, "Oh no, I have to go to that place again."
Sheryl Sandberg once said, "leadership is about making others better as a result of your presence and making sure that impact lasts in your absence." These are words that I live by. Leading people is a privilege; when you do so with passion and empathy, the entire organization will reap the rewards. 
Unsurprisingly, an engaged team produces better results, regardless of the industry and company size. Here are a few ways we've approached building our company culture within our IT department:
- Cultivate a Continuous Learning Culture  – A successful IT team must create value by marrying IT investments that match the business strategy and drive growth outcomes. At Kellogg, we know that to achieve this, we must focus on growing the talents of our team.  
We invest heavily in skills and leadership development. In 2021 we launched YODA (Year of Development, Always), which is about creating career-long learning opportunities to help our team learn new skills around technology, data and analytics as technology is forever evolving.


- Purpose  – In times of change, purpose is a grounding for resilience, giving people a reason to get up and go the extra mile every day. At Kellogg, our vision is a good and just world where people are not just fed but fulfilled. Our purpose is to create better days and a place at the table (or keyboard) for everyone. That sense of purpose is the bedrock for how we approach everything – from people, processes, technology, and data – and, ultimately, how we're creating the future of food.


- One Team Mantra – Regardless of whether you report to the IT function, we are continuously breaking down silos, partnering, and experimenting with the commercial teams to drive business outcomes.
For example, in 2020, a team member attended an event and learned that more than 2 million people in the UK live with sight loss and cannot read the information on the packaging. It sparked an idea to add Navilens technology to our packaging, allowing visually impaired people to access all of the information on our cereal packaging via their smartphones – either by having it played aloud or using accessibility tools.
Kellogg became the first company in the world to include NaviLens on our packaging, and later this year we're expanding the offering in the United States.
My leadership team and I model an inclusive culture that invites colleagues at every level of the team to play their part in creating the future of Kellogg IT.


- A Winning Strategy – Earlier this year, Kellogg announced it would spin off our North American cereal and plant-based foods businesses to result in three independent public companies. This strategy will allow us to build tighter connections across the consumer journey and presents a massive opportunity for the IT team to make the company future-ready with suitable systems and capabilities.
By focusing on these four strategies, we're creating a workplace defined by personalized solutions, well-being, and a focus on experimentation, culture, and inclusivity. A team becomes the competitive advantage when you get this right. Are you interested in helping us create the future of food? Learn about what exciting opportunities we have here.

DEL MAR, Calif., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- A luxury home in one of San Diego County's boutique residential enclaves has been scheduled for sale at a luxury auction® on November 19. The property first hit the market asking $8 million, though it will now be offered without reserve in next Saturday's sale, meaning it will be sold to the auction's highest bidder regardless of the amount of the high bid. The homeowners retained property auction specialist Platinum Luxury Auctions for the sale. Platinum is working in tandem with the property's listing brokerage of record, Agentdesks Incorporated, out of San Francisco, CA.

A luxury home in one of San Diego County's boutique residential enclaves has been scheduled for sale at a luxury auction The residence is located within the community of Rancho Del Mar , a private and gated development of only 27 luxury homes located adjacent to the Lomas Santa Fe Country Club. The community is also within 1-1.5 miles of the Fairbanks Ranch Country Club and Morgan's Run Club and Resort. Solana Beach and the glistening Pacific Ocean are just a 5-min drive from the property's front door.
"The property's location is terrific for avid golfers, beachgoers, or for those simply seeking the peace of mind and  relaxed lifestyle provided by living in a boutique, gated community," said Trayor Lesnock, Platinum's founder and president. "And being 20 minutes from central San Diego is ideal for business commuters and frequent travelers."
Sited on a one-half-acre lot and perched atop a hillside, the parcel features mature landscaping that offers added privacy, while still allowing for views of the Loma Santa Fe golf course, especially from the various terraces on the second story.
The home's three living levels combine for a total of 8,500 square feet of living area, with 6 bedrooms, 7 full and one-half baths. The current owners built the home in 2011, enlisting the help of local architect William Currier to create the Tuscan-inspired abode. Thanks to one of the owners having a business background in the import and export of European building materials, the property's design benefits from the extensive use of fine marbles, custom stone and brick, and beautiful wooden beams throughout.
Prominent interior features include a 2-story foyer with dual staircases and large chandelier, sprawling grand salon with soaring ceilings, a wet bar, fireplace lounge, formal dining, in-law's suite with kitchenette, and a gourmet kitchen with top-of-the-line appliances and a Wood Stone pizza oven. The lowermost level also includes multiple entertainment areas, a fitness center, and a climate-controlled wine room with an oversized tasting lounge.
Outdoors, a cozy loggia with a firepit and surround seating, additional stone fireplace and adjacent summer kitchen/bar continue the Tuscan ambiance, while a more tropical atmosphere is provided by a custom, resort-style pool and spa with waterfall features, surrounded by a stone paver pool deck.
Interested buyers and real estate brokers may tour the property between the hours of 11am and 5pm PT daily, until the auction date. Those wishing to schedule a tour must make an appointment in advance by contacting Platinum's project manager, Walter Cerini, at 800.683.3789.

BOCA RATON, Fla., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Students studying on the road to becoming mental health physicians or professionals in the United States who applied for the Karen Corcoran Walsh scholarship for mental health awareness can now know the results of their application. The scholarship was available for all eligible students enrolled in an accredited university or college studying to become mental health professionals.

Karen and her team read through the applications and the student who had the most outstanding and creative response to the question was selected.
Education is a very important and key component of all mental health professionals. Although there are many students out there who dare to dream to become mental professionals, not all are lucky enough to afford the money needed for tuition fees.

It is because of this reason that she decided to reward the most deserving student with a scholarship fund to ease the financial burden. Through her scholarship, she is hoping that the winner of her scholarship will be able to focus on achieving success in the mental health professional field.
Karen Corcoran Walsh is not only a therapist but also a mental health specialist and educator. Karen has over 22 years of experience in the mental health field and she has first-hand knowledge of what the journey is like. Karen has dedicated her life to helping people, especially those with mental health conditions and issues. Karen's main focus is on families and adolescents who are struggling with mental problems. She made a bold step to give back to the future generation of mental health professionals by awarding them with a scholarship for mental health. All the applications were thoroughly assessed and one lucky winner was selected. Karen hopes that the winner of the scholarship will not only have a successful career but also be a future leader in the mental health industry

Full text: UL Solutions supports the supply chain and transportation communities to foster trust and transparency around transporting dangerous goods ahead of the holiday shopping season when there is an uptick in the shipment of products containing lithium-ion batteries.
NORTHBROOK, Ill., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- UL Solutions, a global leader in applied safety science, today announced its industry-first dangerous goods process management (DGPM) certification program. The program focuses on lithium-ion batteries, which are regulated as a hazardous material by the U.S. Department of Transportation. It aims to help companies that ship lithium-ion batteries and products that contain them mitigate safety risks.
Increased market demand for lithium-ion batteries and products that contain them has contributed to a rise in thermal runaway events during transportation. A thermal runaway event is a phenomenon in which the lithium-ion cell enters an uncontrollable, self-heating state, posing a potential safety risk to crews, passengers and the general public The DGPM certification program allows organizations to demonstrate conformance to the U.S. Department of Transportation Hazardous Material's regulations and verify that appropriate processes are in place for moving dangerous goods.
The DGPM certification program assesses an organization's management system and processes related to the transportation of dangerous goods by road, rail, vessel or air against applicable regulations, agreements, codes of practice and legislation. UL Solutions conducts audits and reviews relevant documentation to determine certification eligibility for organizations that offer dangerous goods for transport. The program applies UL Solutions' safety science expertise in batteries, supplier quality audits and regulatory compliance.
"The importance of the DGPM certification program takes on a greater role as we approach the holiday season and there is an uptick in the shipment of products containing lithium-ion batteries," said Michelle Chevalier, global account manager at UL Solutions. "Our DGPM certification program leverages cross-functional safety science expertise, data and our independent, third-party auditing services to support transparency and empower trust throughout the supply chain."

Full text: In a new supplemental eBook ahead of the holiday season, the global consulting firm highlights continuous monitoring and open-source data as tools to fight fraud.
PURCELLVILLE, Va., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Global risk management and consulting firm Lowers Risk Group announced today its participation in International Fraud Awareness Week. As part of its organization-wide support, Lowers Risk Group subsidiary company Lowers & Associates debuted a new eBook that provides handlers of high-value assets with the latest insights on managing fraud during the upcoming holiday season.
A global effort designed to minimize the impact of fraud by promoting anti-fraud awareness and education, Fraud Week is an initiative led by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners. Lowers Risk Group has participated since its inception and with Preventing Holiday Fraud: Insights and Best Practices for Handlers of High-Value Assets, incorporates timely statistics from the ACFE's recent 2022 State of the Nation report on occupational fraud with its real-world insights, experience, and resources.
"The current threat environment includes pressure from inflation, supply and distribution challenges, skilled labor shortages, and skyrocketing cybercrime," Lowers Risk Group CEO Mark Lowers, said. "It's unlike anything I've seen in my 40 years in this business. But as always, it's in these moments that prevention and detection matter most."
"The ACFE does incredible work, and the Lowers & Associates team has developed this eBook as a companion piece to their State of the Nation report," Jon Groussman, President of Lowers & Associates, said. "Our team of fraud examiners specifically looked to provide high-value asset handlers (and the insurers that represent them) the insights to rise above the perfect storm of risk threatening their business this holiday season."
The eBook features multimedia assets, statistics, how-to's, and real-world applications of the Fraud Triangle and fraud risk management principles to tackle human capital and occupational fraud risks like remote work, cybersecurity, lapsed operational policies, and more. At the center of the discussion is how advances in technology and data provide opportunities to stay ahead of threats in real-time and position businesses for holiday success and year-round growth.

Full text: DENVER, Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Lumino , a leading marketing & communications agency, has launched a new training course to help entry-level account service hires better manage key accounts.
Lumino launches one-of-a-kind virtual academy to train new agency hires to manage key accounts This kind of training is timely, as a few key accounts often account for one-third of an organization's revenue, according to Gartner . Nurturing and growing these relationships is thus critical, especially for agencies that are ready to expand. But new account management hires often require extensive on-the-job training before they're ready to succeed without supervision.
"The training process for new hires is usually just throwing them into the middle of the project and then praying they can figure things out," says Lumino CEO and CSA Founder Jenny Karn.

Full text: NASHVILLE, Tenn., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The CIRCLES Consortium , consisting of Vanderbilt University and several other universities, in coordination with Nissan North America, Toyota, GM, and the Tennessee Department of Transportation, will test 100 AI-equipped vehicles in an effort to mitigate human-caused traffic jams.
The experiments are scheduled to occur along a four-mile stretch of I-24 starting on Monday, Nov. 14 through Friday, Nov. 18, 2022, between the hours of 5 a.m. and 10:30 a.m., integrated into the normal flow of traffic.
The I-24 MOTION testbed, where the AI-equipped vehicles will travel in the normal flow of traffic, is the only automotive testing environment of its kind in the U.S. It is opening in fall 2022 and is equipped with 300 4K digital sensors that are mounted on poles spaced 600 feet apart. The system generates data on the 260,000,000 vehicle-miles of traffic that occurs annually within the testbed.
In this experiment, researchers from the CIRCLES Consortium will deploy up to 100 vehicles, comprised of Nissan Rogue, Toyota RAV4 and a Cadillac XT5, that each include an AI-equipped adaptive cruise control technology used in an earlier experiment.
In that test—conducted with 20 cars on a closed track—just one vehicle equipped with the AI system changed the driving behavior of the other 20 cars, alleviating the stop-and-go dynamic that often leads to traffic jams with no obvious cause. Because of the ripple effects that the AI-equipped cars had on other drivers, researchers measured a sizeable fuel savings compared with driving in typical traffic jams.
As researchers increase the scale of the testing and introduce real world driving conditions, they will investigate whether the improved traffic and fuel-economy outcomes measured in the smaller study continue to hold.
This research is supported by the National Science Foundation, as well as the U.S. Departments of Transportation and Energy. Support was also provided by Toyota North America and General Motors.

Full text: Two seasoned IT and HR executives bring deep expertise to national design and construction management firm as it expands into new regions and industry sectors
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- McKissack & McKissack, one of the nation's leading Black- and woman-owned architecture, engineering and construction companies, today announced the addition of two new members to its national leadership team in its Washington, D.C., office: Lisa Edmonds as vice president of human resources and Nijah Barley as director of information technology. Each brings noteworthy core competencies and experience to the company as it undergoes unprecedented growth.
"I am excited about Lisa and Nijah because they will apply deep expertise and fresh perspectives to two of the most important aspects of our company's strategic growth—our supportive people-oriented culture and our robust information technology infrastructure," said Deryl McKissack, president and CEO of McKissack & McKissack.
"We've been growing quickly at McKissack and expect to maintain that momentum because of the infrastructure act, so we need Lisa for her depth of knowledge and deep networking skills to help us recruit top-notch talent. McKissack is a great place to work, and Lisa has the skillset and strategic acumen bring that message to a new pool of talent and optimize our staffing process," McKissack noted. 
"I expect Nijah to make a major impact at our company too. He's incredibly creative and always thinking out-of-the-box to find better ways to serve us and our clients. He approaches every challenge with such positivity. His mantra is always 'I can figure it out, I can help you'—and he always does just that," she added.
Lisa Edmonds: Combining HR and legal background to support talent acquisition strategies
Edmonds brings to McKissack more than two decades of human resources experience, most recently as human resource manager/benefits administrator of engineering and design firm Gibbs & Cox Inc. "Lisa is a welcome addition to our team for many reasons, but what stood out to me initially is the fact that she understands the mindset of engineers and designers," said McKissack. "Even though we are known for our fulfilling and inclusive culture, we are a national company with professionals from many different fields and all walks of life on staff. Her expertise in so many aspects of our expansive industry will help us strengthen and support all members of our diverse team."
Edmonds has also studied HR and employment law, which McKissack sees as another strength. "We work in several states. They all have different approaches legally on human resources, so someone who knows these intricacies and can anticipate our needs in all settings is a key addition to our team," McKissack pointed out.
Edmonds said, "So much of HR revolves around employment law, beginning with the recruitment process. And once someone is here, we need to make sure that we as a company are doing things the right way."
With McKissack expanding into new sectors and growing the depth and breadth of its project portfolio, Edmonds noted, "Our main priority is recruitment and development of impressive and accomplished talent. And once we recruit that talent, we want them to stay. Retaining new talent and the great employees we already have is critical to our growth and ultimately the success of everything we do. So, we're going to support all team members with training and development that will refine or deepen their skillsets. Our goal is to build on the culture that is already established at McKissack, which is humble, hungry and smart."
Edmonds holds a bachelor's degree in business administration from Capella University in Minneapolis as well as a master's in legal studies from Arizona State University's Sandra Day O'Connor School of Law in Phoenix. She is certified as a Group Benefits Administrator, a Senior Professional in Human Resources and a Project Management Professional (PMP). She lives in South Maryland with her husband.
Edmonds said, "I came to work with McKissack because I was impressed with the leadership, I was impressed with the growth, and I was really impressed with the history. I was impressed with how the company started and where it's going. I had been with my previous employer for 10 years and I'm hoping to exceed that timeframe at McKissack. It's a company that represents achievement, especially for women and minorities, and I hope to strengthen its reputation with great accomplishments while I'm here."
Nijah Barley is bringing amplified tech experience back to the MWBE where he started
Barley is a seasoned IT expert with a track record of implementing new technologies and systems to improve company productivity and profit. His new position is a homecoming. He began his career at McKissack after graduating college, supporting the firm's increasingly progressive IT systems to sustain cutting edge developments in program management and construction management, architecture and engineering.
After four years at McKissack, Barley moved to the Washington office of McKinsey & Co., where he spent three years working with teams around the world and learning largescale enterprise systems. His was there during the Covid-19 pandemic and helped transition 1,500 colleagues to virtual options for the shift to work-from-home. Throughout, he kept in touch with former colleagues and his mentor, McKissack's former V.P. of IT Andrew Corn.
"McKissack was much more than just a job; the team and Deryl are my family. When I went to McKinsey, it was always with the intention that I would return someday to bring back what I learned," he said. "I knew that I needed to learn, have exposure to other industries and develop a broader skillset to bring back different tools and a growth mindset."
Now that he oversees McKissack's IT department, he plans to build on the company's existing cloud infrastructure to not only maximize productivity but also embrace vanguard technologies as they emerge. Priorities include innovation, cybersecurity and adhering to industry best practice. "I'm looking to increase the odds of our success for the work we try to win and make sure that the work we're putting forward is gold-star standard and leaves a lasting impression with clients," he said.
Barley, who's originally from Brooklyn and now lives in Silver Spring, Md., graduated from Howard University in Washington with a bachelor's degree. While a student, he worked on Howard's IT support desk. He recalled, "I'll never forget the day when I walked in for my first interview at McKissack & McKissack. I was just astounded by a fellow Howard University grad, Deryl McKissack, having an office in downtown D.C. and being the founder and CEO of such a thriving business with so much history. That has always stuck with me."

Full text: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The below remarks are as prepared for delivery by Postmaster General and CEO Louis DeJoy during the open session meeting of the Postal Service Board of Governors on Nov. 10, 2022.
"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank all our Governors for their commitment to public service and their support for our initiatives to transform the Postal Service.
As the Chairman has identified, we have accomplished a great deal since the release of the Delivering for America Plan.
The Postal Service's new organizational structure and improving operational discipline, combined with a purposeful long-term strategy, has made the organization more confident in pursuing its transformative agenda to accomplish its public service mission— which is to deliver to 163 million addresses and cover all of its cost through selling its products and services.
Over the last two years we have stabilized our operations, evolved our products, improved our service, strengthened our balance sheet, halved our projected losses and—motivated our employees to join us in this transformation.
I am proud of our leadership team, our union leadership, and our whole organization, for their willingness to pursue the rescue operations necessary to stabilize this cherished institution and set it on a course for a brighter future.
While a lot has been accomplished, there is still much more to be done.
We still face significant losses, our carriers still drive 30-year-old vehicles, our plants and post offices still have significant deferred maintenance and are not aligned for the intended mission and our technology and business processes need to be brought into the modern era.
This leadership team is committed to moving as fast as possible to accomplish the major changes necessary to improve this condition and the financial trajectory.
While we are committed to our public service mission, we must move at the speed of private industry, if not faster, to effect this transformation before we again begin to drain our cash position.
As the Postal Reform Acts states, we must move mail and packages in an integrated network and deliver to 163 million delivery points six days a week and cover our cost.
And our mission to serve is growing. Our delivery points continue to expand with over 1.7 million new addresses added just last year, while mail volume continues to decline-by approximately 3% annually.
Albeit improving, the Postal Service currently does not have an integrated mail and package network that satisfies our service and cost objectives.
We need to configure one from within our existing infrastructure while serving the nation. It is the only successful path forward to avoid future government funding.
This means from collections to delivery, aggregated mail and packages should progress through a series of logically sequenced value added and cost-effective facilities and processes.
This is what is needed to grow our revenue, reduce our operating cost, and reduce our carbon footprint.  As I have said before, this means change—a lot of it—and it takes time.
With stakeholder cooperation, this will take five years to mostly accomplish.  Without stakeholder cooperation, a lot longer.
We have a plan that will serve the American people and our mail and package customers and conform to the laws and we are marching forward with it.
Unfortunately, with all that has been accomplished financially, our 2023 budget will not show the breakeven results we were striving for.
As our CFO will later show you, our budget for next year includes close to $3 billion dollars of CSRS costs and $1.5 billion of inflation costs over what we planned. Having said that, the Postal Service continues to move forward with its various cost and revenue initiatives to improve.
Financial predictability and success will come when we get the administrative correction for CSRS and we begin to bare the fruits of the changes to our network underway.
In the meantime, the leadership team and the whole organization will continue to grind out the cost and revenue improvements we can attain – while delivering improving service performance – as identified in our 10- year plan.
Concerning the coming peak season, we are well prepared with the significant increase in processing equipment and improvement in operating techniques deployed over the last two years.
We have also stabilized our workforce and require adding only 20,000 seasonal workers for this year's peak.
For perspective, last month the postal service delivered over 567 million packages across our 163 million delivery points. Over 99% of those deliveries received 90% on time delivery service throughout the country. We accomplished this while delivering 11.3 billion pieces of mail with similar success.
Our customers and the American people should feel confident in the service we will provide for the holiday season, so use us to fill you orders, send your gifts, mail your holiday cards and letters and conduct your normal business. We will not disappoint.
Concerning other matters of interest, we continue to work our strategy for vehicle acquisitions and look forward to filing our SEIS as soon as possible.
I now want to thank all our employees for another successful engagement in the election process. I haven't seen the final performance numbers yet, but I am sure they are going to be great.
A special thanks to Adrienne Marshall our Director of Election and Government Mail, to our Union task force and to Governor McReynolds and our Board Election Committee.
Your contributions are of great value to the Postal Service and the American people.
And finally, I would like to wish our leadership team, our Governors, our employees, our stakeholders and all Americans a safe and happy holiday season and I hope everyone receives lots of goodies through the mail."

Survey: 76% of banking execs say sector has 'obligation' to pursue social good

Full text: SAS-sponsored global survey of banking executives by Economist Impact shows an industry preparing for post-digitalization, purpose-driven banking by 2035
CARY, N.C., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- From shifting market dynamics and mounting geopolitical tensions to skyrocketing cyber threats and a worsening climate crisis, the world faces risk and uncertainty on many fronts. How are these and other prevailing trends reshaping financial services? A global future of banking survey  by Economist Impact – and sponsored by analytics heavyweight SAS – snapshots a sector in transition, its leaders contemplating a more conscientious, purpose-driven trajectory.

The Banking in 2035: global banking survey report explores insights shared by approximately 500 decision makers, director-level and above, from corporate, commercial, retail and digital banks worldwide. Supplementing the report, users can explore the survey data in-depth via SAS' online dashboard , which enables regional filtering and more.
Banking for better
Notably, the report reveals overwhelming support for more socially responsible business practices. When asked about the financial services industry's role in promoting social good, the survey found:
- Three-quarters (76%) of executives believe the industry "has a strong obligation" to address societal needs and issues – and a third (32%) say the industry must play "a central role."
- About four in five (79%) think that the industry should be "more engaged" in addressing societal issues.
- A large majority (82%) believe that financial services organizations can simultaneously better society while pursuing profit. Among C-suite respondents, that figure is even higher, 91%.

"The rallying cry is resounding for the financial services sector: Purpose-driven banking is the future," said Theo Lau, renowned industry commentator, author and founder of Unconventional Ventures. "Investing for social and environmental good, promoting forward-thinking transparency beyond compliance, and making banking fully digital and more accessible to under- and unbanked populations – these concepts are not superfluous. They're essential to helping banks evolve their missions and business models to deliver new value to stakeholders and drive toward a better future for people and the planet."
Risks abound – but also opportunities
The survey captured a cautious optimism among bank executives, even as they confront disruptive trends, internal and external barriers, and mounting societal and environmental issues, including:
- A burgeoning digital revolution: The "digitalization of financial services and adoption of emerging technologies" topped the industry's most influential trends , cited by 55% of respondents. The emergence of digital currencies followed closely behind, cited by 49%. These trends also capped the industry's greatest opportunities , each noted by 54% of respondents.
- Rising cyber risks: The increasing threat of cyberattacks arose the most cited risk among the trends, identified by 53% of respondents. How are banks responding? Nearly half (49%) of executives specified security and data protection investments as a top strategy for staying ahead of trends; 44% also pointed to enhanced data sharing between their fraud detection, digital payments and anti-money laundering functions.
- Vexing environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.  The majority (64%) of executives believe banking trails other sectors in advancing its ESG goals – but it's clear banks' ESG agendas are coming into sharper focus. Two in five (41%) execs selected ESG as among their organizations' greatest opportunities. About half (52%) named environmental sustainability and climate change among the top issues in which their organization is most engaged in addressing societal needs.

Analytics paves a path forward
This survey report marks the second installment in a two-part study. The survey itself helped underpin the initial Banking in 2035: three possible futures  report, a qualitative exploration of three potential future states of the industry, brimming with insights on how major trends, and banks' responses, might reshape the landscape.
Come what may, executives recognize the importance of technology in building resilience and forging a brighter future – both for their own organizations and the entire industry. Almost half (48%) identified advanced analytics as the most important technology needed to keep their organizations competitive as long-term trends redefine the banking world. Likewise, more than three-quarters (77%) rate their organization as either on-track (35%) or ahead (42%) in meeting their digital transformation goals.
Indeed, digital transformation topped the list of strategic priorities where executives will focus over the next three to five years, noted by 57% of execs, followed by security and data protection (55%). Customer experience and risk management followed with 39% each.
"The great potential we're seeing now for banking in 2035 will be powered by analytics and AI in the cloud," said Alex Kwiatkowski, Director of Global Financial Services at SAS. "Banking leaders understand that they can't scale a sea change without rendering their organization's functioning into insights that are easy to share with stakeholders and the public. Achieving optimal performance is accomplished by making optimal decisions, informed by data."

Aon Expands Catastrophe Modeling and Consultancy Capabilities with Acquisition of ERN in Latin America

Full text: LONDON, Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Aon plc (NYSE: AON), a leading global professional services firm, today announced the expansion of the its catastrophe modeling and consultancy capabilities in Latin America with the acquisition of ERN (Evaluación de Riesgos Naturales), a Mexico-based leader in risk assessment modeling.
The acquisition aims to bring additional value to Aon's insurer clients, which face three key issues in navigating natural catastrophe and climate volatility: the increasing cost of secondary perils, the ability to understand an evolving climate, and the need to create a custom view of risk to make better business decisions. Aon is working with clients to develop their own view of risk – an important component in achieving the differentiation necessary for successful renewals outcomes in the tightening reinsurance market.
Over the past decade, Latin America experienced $64.4 billion in insured losses, predominantly driven by tropical hurricanes, followed by earthquake, drought and flooding. In response to these the challenges, the acquisition of ERN expands Aon's catastrophe modeling suite by introducing earthquake and hurricane modeling for Latin America and the Caribbean.
The transaction sees ERN joining Aon's Reinsurance Solutions business, where it will collaborate with the Impact Forecasting team, whose modeling suite enables firms to analyze the financial impacts of catastrophic events with a view to developing effective reinsurance, underwriting and exposure management strategies.
"The acquisition aligns within Aon's global position as a leader in data and analytics solutions for the re/insurance industry, our focus on catastrophe model development in Latin America, and our use of scientific research, academic collaborations and robust analytics to build innovative risk solutions for the public and private sectors," said Keith Lawler, managing director of Aon's Reinsurance Solutions in Latin America. "We are excited to welcome the ERN team as we together pursue our shared commitment in helping our insurer clients to differentiate themselves, both in their understanding of how climate change and natural catastrophes affect their businesses, and in how they communicate this view of risk to their reinsurance carriers." 
Founded in 1996, ERN has developed modeling capabilities that are specific to Latin America and backed by strong expertise and research. Lawler will serve as CEO of this business and ERN founders Eduardo Reinoso and Dr. Mario Ordaz will join Aon as senior scientific advisors.
"Throughout the last 26 years, ERN has built a highly respected brand and has utilized a broad range of modeling platforms that assist clients analyzing many risks," said Dr. Ordaz. "Joining Aon can take us to the next level in terms of reach and delivery, contributing even more to reducing possible human and material losses from natural and man-made catastrophes."
The acquisition expands Aon's wider efforts to quantify natural catastrophes and climate risk globally. Aon is collaborating with leading academic institutions worldwide to better understand and apply evolving climate research, including, most recently, with the University of California, Merced and the University of California, Los Angeles to implement the latest climate change science and research into Aon's U.S. wildfire catastrophe model.
Terms of the transaction, which has closed, were not disclosed.

RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA, Calif., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Meister Solutions today announced the release of DryMeister, a new and innovative tool that makes it easier to dry containers with hard-to-reach areas. DryMeister is fun to use, and gives users the satisfaction of immediately drying the inside of containers after washing them.
"Drying items such as reusable water bottles, flower vases, baby bottles, wine carafes, coffee pots and hydration packs has never been easier," says Aimee Roberson, product inventor and Founder of Meister Solutions. "DryMeister is a patented drying tool designed to quickly and efficiently dry leftover water droplets in containers that would otherwise be difficult, or take a long time to air dry."
- DryMeister helps reduce the risk of bacteria exposure from using dirty dish towels for drying
- Individually wrapped, reusable yet disposable drying heads are made of an absorbent material that wicks water and locks it in
- Minimize countertop clutter by drying items and putting them away instead of leaving them out to air dry
- Keeps containers free of scum when they are properly dried after being washed
- Most containers have a dry, streak-free finish after use

DryMeister products are now available for purchase on Amazon.com and DryMeister.com. The Starter Kit retails for $21.99 and each Refill pack, available in 2 sizes, retails for $15.99.

Full text: Hypertension, or high blood pressure, puts patients at risk for heart disease and stroke. Only 1 in 4 adults (24%) with hypertension have their condition under control and subsequently both are leading causes of death in the United States. Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) has tapped into a resource that allows patients to better manage their high blood pressure. In a recent internal study, RPM Healthcare found that 74% of patients enrolled in their program saw a reduction in systolic and/or diastolic readings after 3 months.
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Hypertension, or high blood pressure, puts patients at risk for heart disease and stroke. Only 1 in 4 adults (24%) with hypertension have their condition under control and subsequently both are leading causes of death in the United States. Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) has tapped into a resource that allows patients to better manage their high blood pressure. In a recent internal study, RPM Healthcare found that 74% of patients enrolled in their program saw a reduction in systolic and/or diastolic readings after 3 months.
RPM Healthcare assists patients with hypertension to better manage their health by collecting physiological data from digital devices and providing daily coaching support and monitoring. Patients receive a health curriculum of educational content and RPM Care Coaches manage alerts then escalate those needing early intervention. For patients categorized as Stage 2+ hypertension with readings of 160 or higher systolic or 90 or higher diastolic, RPM Healthcare saw an average drop of 11.2% or 20 point drop in systolic reading (from 170 to 150) and a 10% average drop in diastolic reading (from 94 to 84) taking place between month 1 and month 3. Furthermore, 50% of patients continue to see their blood pressure drop after 6 months in their program.
"Many factors that lead to heart disease are not under our control, like age or gender, but luckily, we can modify some things. Hypertension is one of those factors. Decrease in blood pressure not only can save lives but will also reduce healthcare costs," stated Irina Koyfman, Population Health Chief at RPM Healthcare. "The amazing work of our Care Coaches leads to not only a drop in blood pressure, but weight loss, medication changes (including deprescribing), and overall better quality of life. We believe in patient-centered care and treating the whole person, not just their disease state. Remote patient monitoring should be rooted in human interaction and compassion, not only devices and readings."
According to the CDC, in 2020, more than 670,000 deaths in the United States had hypertension as a primary or contributing cause. Doctors have routinely guided their patients on how to prevent and lower hypertension by recommending patients maintain a healthy weight, exercise regularly, reduce salt intake and learn to manage tension or stress. However, once these measures are discussed in the office and the patients return home, the guidance may not be followed. Yet, when doctors couple these recommendations with registering their patients in an RPM program, significantly better results are achieved. Contributing factors include quicker provider intervention, better response to therapy and a Care Team supporting a patient's journey to take a more active role in their health care.
"The reduction we saw in systolic and diastolic readings after 3 months is impressive. These results highlight that combining technology with a physician's guidance creates an optimal outcome for patients and enhances the way healthcare is delivered," stated Lyle Dennis, Chief Medical Officer and Co-Founder of RPM Healthcare. "Remote patient monitoring makes healthcare systems more efficient; patients are more receptive and engaged in their healthcare and physicians are provided with valuable data to enhance decision-making."

Full text: "Crown Royal Honors the Military Community Ahead of Veteran's Day announcing a donation to CreatiVets as part of the Crown Royal Generosity Fund $1 million commitment to serving those who serve us"
NASHVILLE, Tenn., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Crown Royal returned to the CMA Awards for its fifth year as the program's exclusive whisky partner, this time with country music superstar Lainey Wilson and nonprofit organization CreatiVets, a charity designed to help veterans heal through music therapy and the arts. The award-winning whisky brand celebrated Country Music's Biggest Night™, which aired live on ABC Wednesday, November 9, by raising a glass to the most generous among us, active-duty military and veterans. CreatiVets founder, Richard Casper, joined Wilson, the CMA Awards New Artist and Female Vocalist winner, live, on-stage to receive a surprise donation of $50,000, on behalf of Crown Royal. Just ahead of Veterans' Day, the brand is proud to honor Casper's selflessness and lifesaving work through the foundation and further its steadfast support of the military community.
The storied Canadian whisky brand also celebrated and hosted veterans from all over the country in Nashville to participate in the Crown Royal Purple Bag Project , an initiative designed in partnership with Packages From Home , which turns donated Crown Royal bags into care packages for military overseas. Leading up to the CMA Awards, country superstar Lainey Wilson surprised the veterans and packed purple bags for active duty service men and women. During the private gathering, Wilson and the veterans not only packed purple bags, but also bonded over their shared love of music. Wilson was able to truly connect with them, hear the veterans' stories, and learn how music continues to play a fundamental role in their healing journey.
"The CMA Awards are so special and getting an opportunity to connect with these veterans, now turned musicians, right before Veterans' Day was truly incredible," said Wilson. "I can tell you firsthand about the healing power of music and it's been a privilege to join Crown Royal and CreatiVets in honoring the military community that I admire and respect so deeply through something I love."
During the show, Wilson gave viewers the opportunity to trigger an additional donation from Crown Royal to CreatiVets by scanning a QR code that appeared onscreen or by visiting www.crownroyal.com/cmascreativets . These donations will be added to the $50,000 Crown Royal will contribute to help CreatiVets continue to serve hundreds of veterans each year through music therapy and songwriting workshops.**
"I am honored CreatiVets is being recognized for the life-saving work we're doing to empower and heal veterans with music," said Richard Casper, founder of CreatiVets. "As we saw last night, music brings people together and I cannot wait to further our mission thanks to the generosity of Crown Royal."
Crown Royal has a deep tradition of giving back, and as a long-standing supporter of the military, is proud to support the most generous people in our communities who selflessly serve others. For over a decade, Crown Royal has ignited exceptional generosity within our communities by giving back to the people and places that support them. Through partnerships with organizations like Packages From Home, the brand has supported over 1 million servicemen and women through the Purple Bag Project. This very season, Crown is taking the bag-packing program that provides food, hygiene, and entertainment items to veterans worldwide, with events all across the country.
"Our brand prides itself on honoring icons that keep their communities thriving and we're thrilled to recognize Richard Casper for his incredible acts of service to the military through CreatiVets. Our longstanding partnership with CMA gives us a platform to amplify the military community we so strongly support and gives them the spotlight they deserve," said Nicky Heckles, Vice President of Crown Royal. "Crown Royal is proud to come together with Lainey Wilson, CreatiVets, and the larger country music family to celebrate veterans who have selflessly served this country."
Crown Royal reminds everyone 21+ that living generously is not about what you have, but about what you give. And, most importantly, to always drink responsibly.

Full text: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has awarded Abt Associates a five-year contract to serve as the data coordinating center for surveillance of post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC). A team of public health, academic, and healthcare partners will assist the CDC in assessing PCC's burden and impact in diverse populations through surveillance and long-term follow-up.
ROCKVILLE, Md., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has awarded Abt Associates a five-year contract to serve as the data coordinating center for surveillance of post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC). PCC may include fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, aching joints, incident depression, and difficulty thinking or concentrating ("brain fog"). A team of public health, academic, and healthcare partners will assist the CDC in assessing PCC's burden and impact in diverse populations through surveillance and long-term follow-up. The project will also explore risk factors for the development, resolution, and prevention of PCC.
As the coordinating center, Abt will ensure standardized data collection across the sites and serve as a data repository. The project's goals are to increase the ability to provide complete, timely, and high-quality PCC surveillance data; identify populations at risk for PCC; promote data exchange and use of data among public health agencies and collaborators; and improve monitoring of PCC trends.
"Data coordinating centers play a crucial role in multi-site research, and Abt is a leader in this space, " said Dr. Danielle Hunt, Abt's principal investigator and vice president, Public Health Portfolio. "With our decade of experience leading data coordinating center activities, CDC relies on us to improve the exchange, quality, and timeliness of data, all of which are critical for public health decision-making."

Haul, store and rendezvous with this new do-it-all system for a hassle-free ski day
BOSTON, Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- TRU-Kii is an emerging brand on the ski scene, introducing a first-of-its-kind Ski Travel System. The TRU-Kii Ski Travel System is designed to haul and store your group or family's ski gear, and serve as a rendezvous point for your entire crew.
Haul, store and rendezvous with TRU-Kii, a new do-it-all system for a hassle-free ski day. Now, ski equipment hauling and organization are no longer a chore, and finding a meet-up point for your ski squad among the crowds is a breeze.
The TRU-Kii Ski Travel System carries the weight of the day in more ways than one. As a cart, it can hold up to four pairs of skis or four snowboards, or two of each. It comes packed in the waterproof Mountain Duffel that holds boot bags, helmets, goggles, snacks and everything in between, so you can stay organized on the mountain. The super strong, road-tested aluminum and steel frame is designed to perfectly balance the load, so you can pull up to 150 pounds with ease.
"Giving families and friends the ability to truly enjoy a day of skiing without the stressful task of lugging equipment to and from the mountain was the ultimate goal for us at TRU-Kii," said Chuck Keegan, founder of TRU-Kii and inventor of the TRU-Kii Ski Travel System. "It took several prototypes and two years to perfect the TRU-Kii Ski Travel System, which evolved into more than just a cart. It's an entire travel system that takes you from car to base with ease, and serves as a rendezvous point for friends and family to meet-up during the ski day."
In addition to hauling and organization, the TRU-Kii Ski Travel system can serve as a central meeting point thanks to its Table Tray accessory. Simply set up TRU-Kii where you want to establish your meeting point, and add the Table Tray accessory to create your own space for drinks and snacks on the mountain. No more fighting for table space during the lunch rush. It is made from sturdy, food-safe melamine that is easily wiped clean and stored in the Mountain Duffel.
The TRU-Kii Ski Travel System retails for $499.99 and the TRU-Kii Table Tray is $59.99. Both are available exclusively at trukii.com beginning Nov. 7, 2022.
ABOUT TRU-Kii TRU-Kii is on a mission to eliminate the chore of lugging ski equipment to the mountain. TRU-Kii provides solutions for families who want to spend more time skiing, and less time worrying about transporting and organizing gear to the slopes. The brand's first product is the TRU-Kii Ski Travel System designed for groups and families to haul, store and rendezvous with this new do-it-all system for a hassle-free ski day. For more information visit trukii.com .

As used in this news release, the term "Liquidation Preference" for a Depositary Share of a series, means an amount equal to the product of the liquidation preference for a share of the applicable underlying preferred stock of Bank of America ($30,000 for a share of preferred stock underlying the Series 1 Depositary Shares and Series 5 Depositary Shares, and $25,000 for a share of preferred stock underlying the Depositary Shares of all other series) and the fractional interest in such share of preferred stock that such Depositary Share represents as set forth in the table above.  For each Listed Depositary Share (as defined below), the Liquidation Preference is $25.00 and for each Non-Listed Depositary Share (as defined below), the Liquidation Preference is $1,000.00.

2     
If, as scheduled, the Settlement Date (as defined below) occurs on December 13, 2022, then the Total Consideration (as defined below) payable for Depositary Shares of a series that are purchased pursuant to an applicable Offer will equal the applicable "Offer Price" for such Depositary Shares as set forth in the table above, plus, if applicable, the hypothetical Accrued Dividends for such Depositary Shares as set forth in the table above or, with respect to the Series E Depositary Shares, the Series 1 Depositary Shares and the Series 5 Depositary Shares, Accrued Dividends (as defined below) determined as described in the Offer to Purchase.

3      
Depositary Shares of this series are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE " ).  Depositary Shares of all series that are listed on the NYSE are referred to herein collectively as the "Listed Depositary Shares . "

4  
The dividend rate for the series of preferred stock represented by this series of Depositary Shares is reset quarterly based on 3-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and will be reset following the date of this news release but prior to the Settlement Date. As a result, the applicable dividend rate that will be used to calculate Accrued Dividends for this series of Depositary Shares is not known, and hypothetical Accrued Dividends and hypothetical Total Consideration cannot be determined, as of the date of this news release.

5
Accrued Dividends will not be included as part of the Total Consideration payable for Depositary Shares of this series. See Section 1 of " The Offers " in the Offer to Purchase.

6  
Depositary Shares of this series are not listed on any exchange and are referred to herein, collectively with Depositary Shares of other non-listed series, as the "Non-Listed Depositary Shares . "

The Offers will expire one minute after 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on December 9, 2022, unless extended or earlier terminated by BofA Securities (such time and date, as the same may be extended with respect to an Offer, the "Expiration Date").
If the aggregate Liquidation Preference of Depositary Shares that are validly tendered as of the Expiration Date, after the application of any applicable Series Caps and proration, exceeds the Maximum Aggregate Purchase Amount, BofA Securities will accept for purchase Depositary Shares in an aggregate Liquidation Preference amount that comes nearest to, but does not exceed, the Maximum Aggregate Purchase Amount.  In such case, BofA Securities will accept Depositary Shares of each series validly tendered in the numerical order of the acceptance priority levels of such series set forth under the "APL" column in the table above (the "Acceptance Priority Levels") of such series, with Acceptance Priority Level 1 being the highest priority level, and subject to the applicable Series Cap and to proration as set forth in the Offer to Purchase.  If, with respect to any series of Depositary Shares for which a Series Cap is specified in the table above, the aggregate Liquidation Preference of such Depositary Shares that are validly tendered as of the Expiration Date exceeds such Series Cap for such series, BofA Securities will accept for purchase such Depositary Shares having an aggregate Liquidation Preference that comes nearest to, but does not exceed, such Series Cap, subject to proration as set forth in the Offer to Purchase.
The total consideration payable for Depositary Shares of a series that are purchased pursuant to the Offers (such amount, with respect to Depositary Shares of a series, the " Total Consideration ") will equal:
- for Series LL Depositary Shares, Series KK Depositary Shares and Series JJ Depositary Shares (together, the " Post-Dividend Depositary Shares "), the "Offer Price" for such Depositary Shares set forth in the table above (such price with respect to a series, the " Offer Price "); and
- for Depositary Shares other than Post-Dividend Depositary Shares, the Offer Price for such Depositary Shares set forth in table above, plus the applicable Accrued Dividends (as defined herein) for such Depositary Shares.

"Accrued Dividends" means, for a series of Depositary Shares other than Post-Dividend Depositary Shares, the accrued and unpaid dividends in respect of the Preferred Stock represented thereby, determined pursuant to the terms thereof, from and including the applicable dividend payment date for such series of Preferred Stock immediately preceding the Settlement Date, to, but excluding, the Settlement Date. As noted in the table above, Accrued Dividends will not be included as part of the Total Consideration payable for any Post-Dividend Depositary Shares purchased in the Offers, and the Total Consideration payable for any such Depositary Shares will consist only of the applicable Offer Price. In addition, the dividend rates for the series of preferred stock represented by the Series E Depositary Shares, the Series 1 Depositary Shares, and the Series 5 Depositary Shares (such series of Depositary Shares collectively, the "LIBOR Depositary Shares") are reset quarterly based on 3-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and will be reset following the date of this news release but prior to the Settlement Date.  As a result, the applicable dividend rates that will be used to calculate Accrued Dividends for such series of Depositary Shares are not known, and hypothetical Accrued Dividends and hypothetical Total Consideration cannot be determined, as of the date of this news release. Once the applicable dividend rates that will be used to calculate Accrued Dividends with respect to the LIBOR Depositary Shares of a series are known, BofA Securities will calculate hypothetical Accrued Dividends and hypothetical Total Consideration for such LIBOR Depositary Shares. Following such calculation, such information will be made available at http://www.dfking.com/bofa and from the Information Agent. In addition, hypothetical Accrued Dividends and hypothetical Total Consideration for the three series of LIBOR Depositary Shares will be announced by means of a news release no later than 4:30 p.m., New York City time, on November 28, 2022.
Note that market prices for the Listed Depositary Shares include accrued but unpaid dividends.  Pursuant to the terms of the Offers, the Total Consideration payable for the Depositary Shares (other than Post-Dividend Depositary Shares) is expressed as the sum of the Offer Price set forth in the table above for such Depositary Shares plus Accrued Dividends.  Accordingly, when comparing the consideration payable in the applicable Offer for Listed Depositary Shares (other than Post-Dividend Depositary Shares) to market prices, you should refer to the sum of the Offer Price and Accrued Dividends.  Market prices for Non-Listed Depositary Shares do not include accrued but unpaid dividends.
The settlement date for each Offer will be promptly after the Expiration Date for such offer (the "Settlement Date"). The Settlement Date for each Offer is scheduled to be December 13, 2022.
Depositary Shares tendered pursuant to an Offer may be validly withdrawn at any time on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by following the procedures set forth in the Offer to Purchase.
Holders are urged to read the Offer Documents carefully before making any decision with respect to an Offer. Holders must make their own decisions as to whether to tender their Depositary Shares, and, if so, the Liquidation Preference of their Depositary Shares to tender.
Holders may obtain copies of the Offer Documents online at the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") at www.sec.gov as exhibits to the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed by Bank of America with the SEC on the date hereof.

Full text: -New preclinical data on lead in vivo programming program, MT-302, demonstrates strong expression and favorable safety in myeloid cells following a single administration in non-human primates; IND filing for MT-302 expected in 2023-
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Myeloid Therapeutics, Inc. ("Myeloid"), a clinical stage mRNA-immunotherapy company, today presented multiple posters on its therapeutics platforms, ATAK™ CAR receptors and in vivo mRNA programming, at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) 37 th Annual Meeting, being held in Boston, MA, November 8-12, 2022.  
"The data presented at SITC further highlight the power of Myeloid's platform to enable broad immune responses and attack cancer cells, supporting the accelerated development of our deep clinical and preclinical  pipeline," said Daniel Getts, Ph.D., CEO of Myeloid.  "In particular, we are really excited about the progress we've made with in vivo programming with MT-302, our TROP2-FcA-LNP, that has shown confirmed tumor killing activity and strong expression in myeloid cells in non-human primates.  We are planning to advance this program into the clinic and expect to file an IND in 2023."  
Myeloid has combined the power of mRNA with proprietary  ATAK™ CAR receptors, to program myeloid cells to target and kill cancer through direct mechanisms and the elicitation of a broad anti-tumor responses, including the activation of T cells.  Myeloid cells are a primary orchestrator of immune response and accumulate naturally within solid tumors, in some cases representing up to seventy-five percent of the tumor mass.   Myeloid's adaptations of mRNA for the myeloid compartment have enabled the evolution to deliver these receptors directly to the patient without any ex-vivo cell engineering.  
Myeloid's novel in vivo engineering platform specifically targets and activates myeloid cells to elicit broader anti-tumor adaptive immunity.  Through this approach, Myeloid demonstrates that delivery of lipid-nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating mRNA results in selective uptake and expression by myeloid cells in vivo, leading to potent tumor killing in multiple cold tumor models.  These data demonstrate the potential for Myeloid's technology to program cells directly in vivo . 
Myeloid's lead program from this platform, MT-302, is a TROP2-FcA-LNP currently in IND-enabling studies for the treatment of multiple indications including colon, lung and breast cancer.  MT-302 has demonstrated strong expression and favorable safety in myeloid cells in two species, rodents and non-human primates.  In addition, treatment with MT-302 demonstrates monotherapy activity in a TROP2/TNBC model, confirming the potency of programmed myeloid cells in the absence of T cells.  Myeloid believes that MT-302 has significant advantages over TROP2-ADC approaches through its ability to engage the full immune response.   
Myeloid's novel class of CARs, known as ATAK™ Receptors, combine tumor recognition with multiple proprietary innate-immune signaling domains.  Myeloid scientists have screened multiple unexplored combinations of innate-immune signals and uncovered optimal multi-signal pathways.  The combination of cancer recognition binders with these novel intracellular signaling domains allows myeloid cells to be reprogrammed with previously unexplored combinations of immune signals, leading to tumor killing and broad systemic anti-tumor responses that support their clinical development in cell therapies.
SITC poster details:
Title: " ATAK receptors, a new class of chimeric antigen receptors that harness innate immunity in myeloid cells to target cancer " 
Poster Number: 393
Session:  Cellular Therapies
Date and Time:   November 10, 2022 9:00 am – 9:00 pm

Full text: Jensen Partners Diversity Report shows meaningful strides toward gender parity in 2022, while gains in racial/ethnic representation remain slow
NEW YORK, Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Jensen Partners, a leading global executive search and corporate advisory firm, has released key data that shows notable progress for alternative asset management firms who made commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in 2022, particularly towards gender parity. The report indicates that major hiring initiatives have increased the ratio of men to women to over 44%, though progress for racial/ethnic representation lags.
The 2022 Diversity Report, A Movement Takes Shape , is informed by data from Jensen DiversityMetrics™, the first enterprise software platform that combines self-reported diversity data and human capital management technology specifically designed to enable asset managers to measure, report, and improve talent management. The report analyzes gender parity rates, racial/ethnic composition, and intersectional seniority across alternative asset classes through data tracked from May 2020 to September 2022, revealing progress that is representative of a lasting movement rather than a waning moment.
"The data we've tracked over the past year sends a clear message: DEI is not a moment – it's a movement," said Sasha Jensen, founder and CEO of Jensen Partners and Jensen DiversityMetrics™. "Though progress looks different for various groups and gains have been uneven, we've witnessed a dramatic shift in attitude across the industry and there is more reason than ever to be optimistic that the DEI movement will continue to accelerate."
As increased pressure is placed on managers to ensure that their investment teams are representative of those who they invest on behalf of, firms have begun to act on strategic DEI initiatives to remain competitive. The commitments that were made in 2020 are beginning to reveal signs of a change towards sweeping advancements for an industry historically dominated by White males.
Across the private credit, private equity, and hedge fund industries, women now represent 44.29%, 44.89%, and 45.38% of marketing and distribution professionals respectively, according to data collected in September 2022. Jensen Partners also tracked a nearly 50% increase in women hired in 2021 versus the same period in 2020, making the overall gender ratio across alternatives 40-50%. Additionally, 42.7% of female moves were concentrated at senior levels compared to 37.8% of moves in 2020.
Racial/ethnic diversity has seen slower growth across asset classes in comparison to gender. When evaluating racial representation, White professionals still account for 70-80% of employees across roles and asset classes, representing slower and uneven progress for different racial/ethnic groups. Women of color continue to be disproportionately disadvantaged regarding both representation and level of seniority. As the data illustrates, 84% of Black women in private equity distribution roles hold junior-level positions. In Q1 2022, the hiring of Black marketing professionals fell to 2.47% of all hires, which is a decrease of 20.06% from Q1 2021. In the same period, Hispanic/Latinx professionals experienced a 314.29% increase in moves. Firms must continue implementing comprehensive DEI strategies and initiatives to make progress for racial/ethnic minorities across asset classes and roles evenly distributed.
Today's alternative investment firms are data-driven, relying heavily on key metrics to help inform nearly every business and investment decision. However, despite leveraging data to drive ideal business outcomes, firms continue to struggle with building and improving workforce diversity. To change this dynamic and to help asset managers instill the same rigorous approach to DEI that is applied to all other core business functions, Jensen Partners launched Jensen DiversityMetrics™ in 2021. Jensen DiversityMetrics™ is the cornerstone of Jensen Partners' executive search and recruitment offerings. It utilizes the powerful combination of quantitative analytics and qualitative information to fuel the Jensen Diversity Pipeline Tracker™, an on-demand diverse candidate pipeline of over 25,000 professionals across the asset management industry. With Jensen DiversityMetrics™, firms can benchmark against competitors, source diverse talent, analyze hiring and retention practices, identify biases in workplace culture, and report progress to investors. The candidate pipeline has also enabled Jensen Partners to pledge that all future searches would begin with an initial candidate pool comprised of, at the least, 51% or more individuals from under-represented backgrounds. The pledge is based in the belief that the lack of diverse professionals across the industry is not the result of a lack of qualified candidates, but rather a systematic failure to hire them.
Jensen Partners regularly reports timely and crucial industry hiring and DEI trends to the public. The data and insight collected and distributed via Jensen Partners reports are leveraged by key players throughout the alternative asset management industry and help instill the level of accountability and transparency required to make steady, meaningful progress on critical challenges facing each and every asset class. The latest report offers updates to Jensen Partners' 2021 findings and data, all of which demonstrate definitive proof of progress and initiatives that can help propel DEI forward for asset managers seeking to move the needle on substantial issues related to diversity and inclusion. The report also includes additional information on the role of salary, culture, and mentorship in building equitable workplaces.
The full 2022 Diversity Report is available for download here.

InspiraTM Technologies Granted Patent by the Israeli Patent Office for Key Safety Component for the INSPIRATM ART System

Full text: RA'ANANA, Israel, Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --  Inspira™ Technologies OXY B.H.N. Ltd. (NASDAQ: IINN) (NASDAQ: IINNW) (the "Company" or "Inspira Technologies"), a groundbreaking respiratory support technology company, announced today that the Israeli Patent Office (ILPO) granted a patent for a key safety component of the INSPIRA TM ART system.
The component is to be located on the patient's neck and is designed to secure a neck cannula from moving or dislodging. Cannula movement can occur during a change of a patient's posture in bed, during physiotherapy treatment, while an awake patient is taken by the medical staff out of bed for a short walk and/or during transportation within and between hospitals.
"We believe that the grant of this patent is another validation of our innovation and supports our core mission for the INSPIRA ART system – to reduce the dependency on invasive mechanical ventilation and improve patient safety and outcomes," stated Inspira's CEO, Dagi Ben-Noon. "This patent is part of the Company's portfolio of patents that are at various phases of the filing process and which we expect to see progress to grant status."
The ILPO is a certified International Searching and Examining Authority (ISA), appointed by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and a party to the PCT-PPH Program, an international initiative amongst 30+ national patent offices to promote work-sharing and enable accelerated patent applicant processing. The Company plans to file for patent coverage in additional countries.
Enhances Usability and Medical Value of INSPIRA ART System
The newly patented technology shall be a key component of the INSPIRA ART system, a potential new mode of acute respiratory care under development, designed to minimize the need for invasive mechanical ventilation allowing the patient to remain awake and maintain spontaneous breathing
The component will be utilized during INSPIRA ART treatment with awake patients, potentially allowing them to be mobile with reduced risk of cannula movement and subsequent bleeding. The Company believes that such improvement in patient safety and mobilization increases patient benefit and enhances the INSPIRA ART system's usability and comprehensive medical value to both patient and medical staff, which may accelerate market adoption. 
Potential Use For ECMO
While the component was initially intended to be a part of the INSPIRA ART system, the Company will also explore the potential early release of the component for the Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) device market. The current ECMO market size (including devices) is estimated at $531 million per annum, with approximately 35,000 ECMO procedures performed each year. 
About Inspira Technologies OXY B.H.N. Ltd.
Inspira Technologies is an innovative medical technology company in the respiratory treatment arena. The Company has developed a breakthrough Augmented Respiration Technology (INSPIRA ART), designed to rebalance patient oxygen saturation levels. This technology potentially allows patients to remain awake during treatment while minimizing the need for highly invasive, risky, and costly mechanical ventilation systems that require intubation and medically induced coma. The Company's products have not yet been tested or used in humans and has not been approved by any regulatory entity.

"We had strong consolidated-level performance in the second quarter, led by double-digit growth in Civil, sequentially better results in Defense, and renewed profitability in Healthcare," said Marc Parent, CAE's President and Chief Executive Officer. "We continued to secure CAE's future with nearly $1.3 billion in total adjusted order intake for a record $10.6 billion adjusted backlog and 1.30 times book-to-sales ratio. In Civil, we booked $751 million in orders for a 1.48 times book-to-sales ratio, including a 15-year training agreement with Qantas and several other aviation training agreements with airlines and business jet operators. We also sold 18 full-flight simulators, bringing our year-to-date tally to 29. In Defense, we booked orders for training and mission support solutions valued at $500 million for 1.13 times book-to-sales, marking the fifth consecutive quarter this ratio has been above one. Our outlook for Civil remains highly positive, with its industry leading positioning expected to enable us to grow significantly through the market recovery and beyond. Defense's sequential growth, paired with the substantial bookings and backlog renewal we are experiencing, gives us confidence in improving near-term performance. Healthcare continues to take share in the simulation and training market, and we expect it to continue to build on its growth momentum. The overall strength we saw in the quarter and current expectations for the balance of the year allow us to reaffirm our outlook for mid-twenty percent consolidated adjusted segment operating income growth this fiscal year and our long-term target of a three-year EPS compound growth rate in the mid-twenty percent range."
Civil Aviation (Civil)
Second quarter Civil revenue was $507.2 million vs. $362.1 million in the second quarter last year. Operating income was $88.4 million compared to $49.9 million in the same quarter last year. Adjusted segment operating income was $104.4 million (20.6% of revenue) compared to $65.3 million (18.0% of revenue) in the second quarter last year. During the quarter, Civil delivered ten full-flight simulators (FFSs) (5) to customers and second quarter Civil training centre utilization (6) was 66%.
During the quarter, Civil signed training solutions contracts valued at $751.1 million, including contracts for 18 FFS sales for a total of 29 for the first half of the fiscal year. Since the end of the quarter, Civil has signed orders for another 5 FFSs, bringing the year-to-date total to 34. Notable training contracts for the quarter include a new 15-year pilot training and operations agreement with Qantas Group, and long-term training agreements or expansions with Virgin Australia, DHL Air UK, JetSmart Airlines, and American Airlines.
The Civil book-to-sales ratio was 1.48x for the quarter and 1.40x for the last 12 months. The Civil adjusted backlog at the end of the quarter was a record $5.5 billion.

Defense and Security (Defense)
Second quarter Defense revenue was $442.4 million, up 6% compared to the second quarter last year. Operating income was $12.1 million compared to a loss of $8.9 million in the same quarter last year. Adjusted segment operating income was $18.4 million (4.2% of revenue), compared to $26.7 million (6.4% of revenue) in the second quarter last year.
Defense booked orders for $499.9 million during the quarter across all domains. In the air domain, CAE signed a contract with Piaggio Aerospace for a P.180 Avanti level-D full-flight simulator to train the Italian Air Force, and it expanded its relationship with Lockheed Martin to support development of several system trainers as well as modification contracts for various C-130 platforms, furthering its strategic relationships with platform original equipment manufacturers. Defense expanded capabilities in the land domain with a prototype development award under the U.S. Army Solider Virtual Trainer (SVT) contract. A component of the Synthetic Training Environment, SVT continues the expansion of synthetic training environments to empower soldier-led training. In the Indo-Pacific region, Defense won a strategic program in the sea domain with the Platforms and Systems Training Contract to support the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Under a 5-year agreement, CAE will support the future training transformation of RAN mariners across four sea platforms, accelerating training throughput and maximizing training capacity and efficiency on-site, in port, and at sea. In the space and cyber domains, Defense won additional awards from its key Space & Missile Defense customer along with cyber technology updates on its core platforms and systems from various customers within the U.S. Department of Defense. CAE's combination of experience, digital technology, and subject matter expertise also provided new opportunities for Defense this quarter with strategic customers like the Air Force Research Lab to develop and demonstrate innovative, mission-effective, unmanned air vehicle capability to assist with manned-unmanned teaming, a U.S. National Defense priority.
The Defense book-to-sales ratio was 1.13x for the quarter and 1.33x for the last 12 months (excluding contract options). The Defense adjusted backlog, including options and CAE's interest in joint ventures, at the end of the quarter was a record $5.2 billion. The Defense pipeline remains strong with some $7.8 billion of bids and proposals pending customer decisions.

Additional financial highlights
CAE incurred restructuring, integration, and acquisition costs of $22.6 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, relating mainly to the fiscal 2022 acquisitions of L3Harris Technologies' Military Training business (L3H MT) and Sabre's AirCentre airline operations portfolio (AirCentre).
Net cash provided by operating activities was $138.0 million for the quarter, compared to $30.9 million in the second quarter last year. Free cash flow (8) was $108.4 million for the quarter compared to $19.4 million in the second quarter last year. The increase was mainly due to higher cash provided by operating activities and a lower investment in non-cash working capital. CAE usually sees a higher level of investment in non-cash working capital accounts during the first half of the fiscal year and tends to see a portion of these investments reverse in the second half.
Income tax expense this quarter amounted to $14.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24%, compared to a negative effective tax rate of 310% for the second quarter last year (negative 1% adjusted for restructuring, integration and acquisition costs last year).
Growth and maintenance capital expenditures (9) totaled $68.6 million this quarter.
Net debt (10) at the end of the quarter was $3,194.6 million for a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA (11) of 4.17x. This compares to net debt of $3,025.9 million and a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 4.15x at the end of the preceding quarter. CAE's total available liquidity as at September 30, 2022 was approximately $1.5 billion.
Adjusted return on capital employed (ROCE) (12) was 5.1% this quarter compared to 5.2% last quarter and 6.6% in the second quarter last year.

Management outlook
Since 2020, CAE has been carrying out a growth strategy which it believes will enable it to emerge from the pandemic a bigger, stronger, and more profitable company than ever before. Specifically, as a waypoint along its journey to cyclical recovery and beyond, the Company is targeting a consolidated adjusted segment operating margin of approximately 17% by the time its markets are generally recovered, with steady room for further improvement thereafter. It expects to reach this level of profitability on a significantly larger base of business with a post-pandemic capital structure that will allow the Company to sustain ample flexibility to balance further investments in its future with capital returns for shareholders. The Company is targeting a three-year (FY23-FY25) EPS compound growth rate in the mid-20% range.
Current headwinds include remaining travel restrictions related to the global pandemic, geopolitical tensions and the war in Ukraine, decades-high inflation, slower global economic growth, a potential European energy crisis, and acute supply chain and labor shortages – any of which may influence the exact timing and rate of market recovery. Notwithstanding the additional volatility induced by these factors, and more acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.
Expected secular trends are highly favorable for all three of the Company's core business segments. Greater desire by airlines to entrust CAE with their critical training and digital operational support and crew management needs, higher expected pilot demand and strong business jet travel demand are enduring positives for the Civil business. Management believes the defence sector is in the early stages of an extended up-cycle driven by geopolitical tensions and increased commitments by governments to defence modernization and readiness. Tailwinds that favour CAE's Defense business include the shift in national defence priorities to an increased focus on near-peer threats and the recognition of the sharply increased need for the kinds of digital immersion-based synthetic solutions that draw from CAE's advances in commercial aviation simulation and training. Healthcare is poised to leverage opportunities presented by an acute nursing shortage and rising demand for Public Safety and Security.
The Company expects the rate of Civil's recovery to pre-pandemic levels and beyond to continue to be driven in large part by the eventual easing of remaining travel restrictions, especially in Asia where China remains a large component of any global recovery scenario. Civil's strong commercial aviation training performance in the Americas and FFS order activity, provide a compelling blueprint for the potential of a broader global commercial aviation recovery. For the balance of fiscal 2023, management expects stronger Civil adjusted segment operating income growth in the second half of the year, weighted to the fourth quarter on higher FFS deliveries to customers, ongoing simulator deployments to CAE's global training network, and seasonality. In addition to continuing to grow its share of the aviation training market and expanding its position in digital flight services, Civil expects to maintain its leading share of FFS sales and to deliver more than 45 FFSs to customers worldwide.
CAE's Defense segment is on a multi-year path to becoming a bigger and more profitable business. Defense is closely aligned with its customers' utmost priorities focused on defending freedom in the face of near-peer threats. In the last two years, Defense has established itself as the world's leading pure-play, platform agnostic, training and simulation business. It is uniquely positioned to draw on CAE's innovations in commercial aviation to transform training with the application of advanced analytics and leading-edge technologies. This is expected to bring increased potential to capture business around the world, accelerated by the acquisition of L3H MT and the expanded capability and customer set this combination provides. This is evidenced by the trailing 12-month book-to-sales ratio of 1.33x. Current geopolitical events have galvanized national defence priorities in the U.S. and across NATO, and management expects increased spending and specific prioritization on defence readiness to translate into additional opportunities for CAE in the years ahead. Defense is expected to continue making good progress with the integration of the L3H MT acquisition in fiscal 2023 and to fully realize $35 to $45 million of cost synergies by fiscal 2024.
In the near term, Defense is expected to continue working its way through the lagging effects of a protracted period of lower than one annual book-to-sales ratios – especially for its higher margin products solutions. Defense also anticipates the current widespread macroeconomic headwinds including supply chain and labor challenges to persist for some time and that order delays will continue to be a factor. In the second half of the current fiscal year, Defense expects to see improved performance over the first half, substantially weighted to the fourth quarter. Underlying this view is management's expectation that some delayed orders will come to fruition, it will execute on programs in adjusted backlog and partially mitigate macroeconomic impacts with internal cost reductions and efficiency initiatives that are expected to ramp up toward the end of the fiscal year. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a catalyst for increased defence budgets; however, the immediate priority on operational needs is contributing to training program award delays in the short-term. CAE continues to expect superior Defense growth over a multi-year period to be driven by the translation of higher-margin order intake and bid activity into revenue, and the progressive realization of synergies related to the L3H MT integration.
In Healthcare, management sees potential for more value creation as it gains share in the healthcare simulation and training market and continues to build on its double-digit revenue growth momentum and increasing profitability.
For the current fiscal year, CAE re-affirms its expectation to deliver mid-20% consolidated adjusted segment operating income growth, primarily driven by its Civil business, and weighted more heavily to the fourth quarter of the year.
Total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million in fiscal 2023, mainly in support of market-led, organic investments. The Company usually sees a higher investment in non-cash working capital accounts in the first half of the fiscal year, and as in previous years, management expects a portion of the non-cash working capital investment to reverse in the second half. The Company continues to target a 100% conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow for the year. Having recently concluded a larger-than-usual inorganic growth investment cycle over the last two years, management is now focused on organic investments in lockstep with customer demand, the integration and ramp up of recent investments, and deleveraging its balance sheet. CAE expects net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA to decrease to a ratio of below three times (3x) by the middle of next fiscal year (FY2024), at which time it expects to be in position to consider reinstating capital returns to shareholders. CAE expects its annual effective income tax rate to be approximately 22%.
Management's outlook for fiscal 2023 and the above targets and expectations constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and are based on a number of assumptions, including in relation to prevailing market conditions, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, supply chains and labor markets, and the timing and degree of easing of global COVID-19-related mobility restrictions. Air travel is a major driver for CAE's business and management relies on analysis from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to inform its assumptions about the rate and profile of recovery in its key civil aviation market. Additionally, as the basis of its fiscal 2023 outlook, management assumes no further disruptions to the global economy, air traffic, CAE's operations, and its ability to deliver products and services. Expectations are also subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and based on assumptions about customer receptivity to CAE's training solutions and operational support solutions as well as material assumptions contained in this press release, quarterly MD&A and in CAE's fiscal 2022 MD&A. Please see the sections below entitled: "Caution concerning forward-looking statements" , "Material assumptions" and "Material risks" .
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)
In November 2022, CAE announced that it raised $1.2 million in its 2022 CAE-Centraide (United Way) fundraising campaign through employee donations, fundraising activities, and a corporate donation, in collaboration with Unifor.  CAE and its employees are extremely proud to be an integral part of the fabric of Greater Montreal and have donated $15.8 million to Centraide of Greater Montreal since 2000. In addition to Centraide, CAE supports the communities in which it operates through donations and sponsorships that mainly support causes in education, civil aviation, defence, security and healthcare. The company also encourages individual and team volunteering through its CAEvolunteering program and donates to several causes supported by employees.
CAE and Air Canada announced in October they are joining together to advance diversity in aviation by doubling the number of 2023 Captain Judy Cameron Scholarships granted to young Canadian women studying to become commercial pilots or maintenance engineers. Up to four aspiring commercial pilots will be invited to join the CAE Women in Flight program as an ambassador.
As the first carbon neutral Canadian aerospace company, CAE continues its efforts to reduce its carbon emissions at the source and to contribute to the sustainability of the industry. CAE is advancing green aviation technology with the development of an electric conversion kit for Piper Archer aircraft. It expects to convert two-thirds of its Piper Aircraft training fleet at its flight schools around the world contributing to a significant reduction of its Scope 1 emissions, while it develops the training for future pilots to operate electric aircraft. In addition, with its Civil digital ecosystem, CAE provides solutions that enable airlines and business jet operators to reduce their carbon footprint through the optimization of flight plans and fuel consumption.
Testament to CAE's thought leadership and commitment to aviation, Marc Parent, President & CEO, was inducted to the Canadian Aviation Hall of Fame, and honored with Aviation Week's Lifetime achievement award, alongside with Steven F. Udvar-Hazy.

Caution concerning limitations of summary earnings press release
This summary earnings press release contains limited information meant to assist the reader in assessing CAE's performance, but it is not a suitable source of information for readers who are unfamiliar with CAE and is not in any way a substitute for the Company's financial statements, notes to the financial statements, and MD&A reports. 
Caution concerning forward-looking statements
This press release includes forward-looking statements about our activities, events and developments that we expect to or anticipate may occur in the future including, for example, statements about our vision, strategies, market trends and outlook, future revenues, capital spending, expansions and new initiatives, financial obligations, available liquidities, expected sales, general economic outlook, prospects and trends of an industry, expected annual recurring cost savings from operational excellence programs, estimated addressable markets, statements relating to our acquisitions of L3H MT and AirCentre, CAE's access to capital resources, the expected accretion in various financial metrics, expectations regarding anticipated cost savings and synergies, the strength, complementarity and compatibility of the L3H MT and AirCentre acquisitions with our existing business and teams, other anticipated benefits of the L3H MT and AirCentre acquisitions and their impact on our future growth, results of operations, performance, business, prospects and opportunities, our business outlook, objectives, development, plans, growth strategies and other strategic priorities, and our leadership position in our markets and other statements that are not historical facts.
Forward-looking statements normally contain words like believe , expect , anticipate , plan, intend , continue , estimate , may , will , should, strategy, future and similar expressions. All such forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the 'safe harbour' provisions of applicable Canadian securities laws and of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
By their nature, forward-looking statements require us to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business which may cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements. While these statements are based on management's expectations and assumptions regarding historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we believe are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as there is a risk that they may not be accurate. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release describe our expectations as of November 10, 2022 and, accordingly, are subject to change after such date. Except as required by law, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The forward-looking information and statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. In addition, statements that "we believe" and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this report. While we believe that information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, that information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements. Except as otherwise indicated by CAE, forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any special items or of any dispositions, monetizations, mergers, acquisitions, other business combinations or other transactions that may occur after November 10, 2022. The financial impact of these transactions and special items can be complex and depends on the facts particular to each of them. We therefore cannot describe the expected impact in a meaningful way or in the same way we present known risks affecting our business. Forward-looking statements are presented in this press release for the purpose of assisting investors and others in understanding certain key elements of our expected fiscal 2023 financial results and in obtaining a better understanding of our anticipated operating environment. Readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. 
Material assumptions
The forward-looking statements set out in this press release are based on certain assumptions including, without limitation: the anticipated negative impacts of the proliferation of new COVID-19 variants of the virus on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition, the prevailing market conditions, customer receptivity to CAE's training and operational support solutions, the accuracy of our estimates of addressable markets and market opportunity, the realization of anticipated annual recurring cost savings and other intended benefits from recent restructuring initiatives and operational excellence programs, the ability to respond to anticipated inflationary pressures and our ability to pass along rising costs through increased prices, the actual impact to supply, production levels, and costs from global supply chain logistics challenges, the stability of foreign exchange rates, the ability to hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the availability of borrowings to be drawn down under, and the utilization, of one or more of our senior credit agreements, our available liquidity from cash and cash equivalents, undrawn amounts on our revolving credit facilities, the balance available under our receivable purchase facility, our cash flows from operations and continued access to debt funding will be sufficient to meet financial requirements in the foreseeable future, access to expected capital resources within anticipated timeframes, no material financial, operational or competitive consequences from changes in regulations affecting our business, our ability to retain and attract new business, our ability to achieve synergies and maintain market position arising from successful integration plans relating to the L3H MT and AirCentre acquisitions, our ability to otherwise complete the integration of the L3H MT and AirCentre businesses acquired within anticipated time periods and at expected cost levels, our ability to attract and retain key employees in connection with the L3H MT and AirCentre acquisitions, management's estimates and expectations in relation to future economic and business conditions and other factors in relation to the L3H MT and AirCentre acquisitions and resulting impact on growth and accretion in various financial metrics, the realization of the expected strategic, financial and other benefits of the L3H MT and AirCentre acquisitions in the timeframe anticipated, economic and political environments and industry conditions, the accuracy and completeness of public and other disclosure, including financial disclosure, by L3Harris Technologies and AirCentre, absence of significant undisclosed costs or liabilities associated with the L3H MT and AirCentre acquisitions. For additional information, including with respect to other assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements made in the press release, refer to the applicable reportable segment in CAE's MD&A for the year ended March 31, 2022. Given the impact of the changing circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and the related response from CAE, governments, regulatory authorities, businesses and customers, there is inherently more uncertainty associated with CAE's assumptions. Air travel is a major driver for CAE's business and management relies on analysis from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to inform its assumptions about the rate and profile of recovery in its key civil aviation market. Accordingly, the assumptions outlined in this report and, consequently, the forward‑looking statements based on such assumptions, may turn out to be inaccurate.
Material risks
Important risk factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our forward-looking statements are set out in CAE's MD&A for the year ended March 31, 2022 filed by CAE with the Canadian Securities Administrators (available at www.sedar.com) and with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (available at www.sec.gov ). The fiscal year 2022 MD&A is also available at www.cae.com. Any one or more of the factors set out in CAE's MD&A may be exacerbated by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and may have a heightened negative impact on CAE's business, results of operations and financial condition. Accordingly, readers are cautioned that any of the disclosed risks could have a material adverse effect on our forward-looking statements. We caution that the disclosed list of risk factors is not exhaustive and other factors could also adversely affect our results.
Non-GAAP and other financial measures
This press release includes non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP ratios, total of segments measures, capital management measures and supplementary financial measures. These measures are useful supplemental information but do not have a standardized meaning according to GAAP. These measures should not be confused with, or used as an alternative for, performance measures calculated according to GAAP. Furthermore, these measures should not be compared with similarly titled measures provided or used by other companies. Management believes that providing certain non-GAAP and other financial measures provides users with a better understanding of our results and trends and provides additional information on our financial and operating performance.
Changes in designation of non-GAAP and other financial measures
In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, in order to incorporate recently published and evolving guidance by the Canadian Securities Administrators, we have changed the designation of the following non-GAAP and supplementary financial measures, without changing the composition of these financial measures:
- Adjusted backlog (formerly referred to as backlog); and
- Adjusted order intake (formerly referred to as order intake).

(1) Adjusted earnings or loss per share is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by excluding restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events, after tax, as well as significant one-time tax items from the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the Company. The effect per share is obtained by dividing these restructuring, integration and acquisition costs and, impairments and other gains and losses, after tax, as well as one-time tax items by the weighted average number of diluted shares. We track it because we believe it provides a better indication of our operating performance on a per share basis and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods.
(2) Adjusted segment operating income or loss is a total of segments measure and is the sum of our key indicators of each segment's financial performance. Adjusted segment operating income or loss gives us an indication of the profitability of each segment because it does not include the impact of any items not specifically related to the segment's performance. We calculate adjusted segment operating income by taking operating income and excluding restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events. We track it because we believe it provides a better indication of our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Additionally, adjusted segment operating income or loss is the profitability measure employed by management for making decisions about allocating resources to segments and assessing segment performance.
(3) Adjusted Order Intake and Adjusted Backlog
Adjusted order intake is a supplementary financial measure that represents the expected value of orders we have received:
- For the Civil Aviation segment, we consider an item part of our adjusted order intake when we have a legally binding commercial agreement with a client that includes enough detail about each party's obligations to form the basis for a contract. Additionally, expected future revenues from customers under short-term and long-term training contracts are included when these customers commit to pay us training fees, or when we reasonably expect the revenue to be generated;
- For the Defense and Security segment, we consider an item part of our adjusted order intake when we have a legally binding commercial agreement with a client that includes enough detail about each party's obligations to form the basis for a contract. Defense and Security contracts are usually executed over a long-term period but some of them must be renewed each year. For this segment, we only include a contract item in adjusted order intake when the customer has authorized the contract item and has received funding for it;
- For the Healthcare segment, adjusted order intake is typically converted into revenue within one year, therefore we assume that adjusted order intake is equal to revenue.

The book-to-sales ratio is the total adjusted order intake divided by total revenue in a given period. We use it to monitor the level of future growth of the business over time.
Total adjusted backlog is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents expected future revenues and includes obligated backlog, joint venture backlog and unfunded backlog and options:
- Obligated backlog represents the value of our adjusted order intake not yet executed and is calculated by adding the adjusted order intake of the current period to the balance of the obligated backlog at the end of the previous fiscal year, subtracting the revenue recognized in the current period and adding or subtracting backlog adjustments. If the amount of an order already recognized in a previous fiscal year is modified, the backlog is revised through adjustments; 
- Joint venture backlog is obligated backlog that represents the expected value of our share of orders that our joint ventures have received but have not yet executed. Joint venture backlog is determined on the same basis as obligated backlog described above; 
- Unfunded backlog represents firm Defense and Security orders we have received but have not yet executed and for which funding authorization has not yet been obtained. Options are included in adjusted backlog when there is a high probability of being exercised, which we define as at least 80% probable, but indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (ID/IQ) contracts are excluded. When an option is exercised, it is considered adjusted order intake in that period and it is removed from unfunded backlog and options.

(4) Adjusted net income or loss is a non-GAAP financial measure we use as an alternate view of our operating results. We calculate it by taking our net income attributable to equity holders of the Company from continuing operations and excluding restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events, after tax, as well as significant one-time tax items. We track it because we believe it provides a better indication of our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods.
(5) A full-flight simulator (FFS) is a full-size replica of a specific make, model and series of an aircraft cockpit, including a motion system. In our count of FFSs in the network, we generally only include FFSs that are of the highest fidelity and do not include any fixed based training devices, or other lower-level devices, as these are typically used in addition to FFSs in the same approved training programs.
(6)  Utilization rate is one of the supplementary financial measures we use to assess the performance of our Civil simulator training network. While utilization rate does not perfectly correlate to revenue recognized, we track it, together with other measures, because we believe it is an indicator of our operating performance. We calculate it by taking the number of training hours sold on our simulators during the period divided by the practical training capacity available for the same period.
(7) SEU is a supplementary financial measure we use to show the total average number of FFSs available to generate earnings during the period.
(8) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that shows us how much cash we have available to invest in growth opportunities, repay debt and meet ongoing financial obligations. We use it as an indicator of our financial strength and liquidity. We calculate it by taking the net cash generated by our continuing operating activities, subtracting maintenance capital expenditures, changes in ERP and other assets not related to growth and dividends paid and adding proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment, dividends received from equity accounted investees and proceeds, net of payments, from equity accounted investees.
(9) Maintenance capital expenditure is a supplementary financial measure we use to calculate the investment needed to sustain the current level of economic activity. Growth capital expenditure is a supplementary financial measure we use to calculate the investment needed to increase the current level of economic activity.
(10) Net debt is a capital management measure we use to monitor how much debt we have after taking into account cash and cash equivalents. We use it as an indicator of our overall financial position, and calculate it by taking our total long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, and subtracting cash and cash equivalents.
(11) Net debt-to-EBITDA and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP ratios calculated as net debt divided by the last twelve months EBITDA. EBITDA comprises earnings before income taxes, finance expense – net, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events. We  use net debt-to-EBITDA and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA because they reflect our ability to service our debt obligations.
(12) Return on capital employed (ROCE) is a non-GAAP ratio calculated over a rolling four-quarter period by taking net income attributable to equity holders of the Company excluding net finance expense, after tax, divided by the average capital employed. Adjusted ROCE  further excludes restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events from net income attributable to equity holders of the Company. We use ROCE and adjusted ROCE to evaluate the profitability of our invested capital.

Full text: PEORIA, Ill., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- K&B Underwriters and VirtuSense Technologies have partnered to offer a win-win scenario for post-acute organizations and their residents. On September 1, 2022, K&B Underwriters launched their new CareAgents program for post-acute healthcare organizations. This program can provide a lower annual insurance premium with the continued use of VirtuSense technology onsite, showing unprecedented trust in AI technology to prevent falls and reduce insurance claims. With this unique program, organizations can leverage VirtuSense's predictive AI technology to lower insurance costs, improve their safety and quality metrics, and protect their residents without increasing staffing.
"At its core, this partnership is helping organizations access proactive care strategies that protect residents. If we can support the use of new technology that has been proven to eliminate falls, we are creating safer, more efficient, and more financially sustainable organizations. The CareAgents program is about making cutting-edge AI technology accessible for more post-acute organizations, and we are proud of that." - Bryan Baird, President, K&B Underwriters, LLC
The CareAgents program supports the use of VirtuSense's AI tools because of their proven outcomes for preventing falls and protecting older adults. VirtuSense provides predictive safety technology for long-term risk reduction in their VSTBalance system or immediate fall prevention for bed-bound residents with their VSTAlert solution. Both technologies utilize advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and Laser Imaging, Detection, and Ranging (LIDAR) sensors to detect the risk of a fall. These AI solutions have had massive impacts on safety and quality of care in post-acute care sites. On average, VSTAlert reduces falls in skilled nursing by 75% and reduces falls with hospitalization by 78%. VSTBalance has been able to increase resident mobility by up to 85% in assisted living communities by detecting deficits in gait and function, allowing them to age in place longer. These benefits lead to a massive reduction in annual falls with injury—increasing resident safety and trust, as well as eliminating medical costs, annual insurance claims, and spending on deductibles. 
The program will increase accessibility to these cutting-edge tools for post-acute organizations like senior living communities, rehab facilities, and skilled nursing communities, who otherwise may not have had the executive support to launch a new fall prevention strategy. Organizations on the CareAgents program can provide high-quality care to their residents while increasing staff efficiency, reducing annual falls, increasing their census, and seeing a reduction in annual insurance claims. VirtuSense and K&B Underwriters are excited to see this strong partnership bring smart fall prevention to more organizations across the country.

Bundle provides a single-product, full-stack AI solution to prevent "shadow AI"

TEL AVIV, Israel, Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Run:ai , the leader in compute orchestration for AI workloads, today announced the launch of the Run:ai MLOps Compute Platform (MCP) powered by NVIDIA DGX™  Systems , a complete, full-stack AI solution for enterprises. Built on NVIDIA DGX systems and using Run:ai Atlas software, Run:ai MCP is an end-to-end AI infrastructure platform that seamlessly orchestrates the hardware and software complexities of AI development and deployment into a single solution, accelerating a company's ROI from artificial intelligence.
Organizations are increasingly turning to AI to grow revenue and improve efficiency. However, each level of the AI stack, from hardware to high-level software, can create challenges and inefficiencies, with multiple teams competing for the same limited GPU computing time. "shadow AI," where individual teams buy their own infrastructure or use pricey cloud compute resources, has become common. This decentralized approach leads to idle resources, duplication, increased expense and delayed time to market. Run:ai MCP is designed to overcome these potential roadblocks to successful AI deployments.
"Enterprises are investing heavily in data science to deliver on the promise of AI, but they lack a single, end-to-end AI infrastructure to ensure access to the resources their practitioners need to succeed," said Omri Geller, co-founder and CEO of Run:ai. "This is a unique, best-in-class hardware/software AI solution that unifies our AI workload orchestration with NVIDIA DGX systems — the universal AI system for every AI workload — to deliver unprecedented compute density, performance and flexibility. Our early design partners have achieved remarkable results with MCP including a 200-500% improved utilization and ROI on their GPUs, which demonstrates the power of this solution to address the biggest bottlenecks in the development of AI."
"AI offers incredible potential for enterprises to grow sales and reduce costs, and simplicity is key for businesses seeking to develop their AI capabilities," said Matt Hull, vice president of Global AI Data Center Solutions at NVIDIA. "As an integrated solution featuring NVIDIA DGX systems and the Run:ai software stack, Run:ai MCP makes it easier for enterprises to add the infrastructure needed to scale their success."
Run:ai MCP powered by NVIDIA DGX systems with NVIDIA Base Command is a full-stack AI solution that can be obtained from distributors and simply installed with world-class enterprise support, including direct access to NVIDIA and Run:ai experts.
With MCP, compute resources are gathered into a centralized pool that can be managed and provisioned by one team, but delivered to many users with self-service access. A cloud-native operating system helps IT manage everything from fractions of NVIDIA GPUs to large-scale distributed training. Run:ai's workload-aware orchestration ensures that every type of AI workload gets the right amount of compute resources when needed. The solution provides MLOps tools while preserving freedom for developers to use their preferred tools via integrations with Kubeflow, Airflow, MLflow and more.
This bundle is the latest in a series of Run:ai's collaborations with NVIDIA, including Run:ai's Atlas Platform certification on the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, which is included with NVIDIA DGX systems.
About Run:ai
Run:ai's Atlas Platform brings cloud-like simplicity to AI resource management — providing researchers with on-demand access to pooled resources for any AI workload. An innovative cloud-native operating system — which includes a workload-aware scheduler and an abstraction layer — helps IT simplify AI implementation, increase team productivity, and gain full utilization of expensive GPUs. Using Run:ai, companies streamline development, management, and scaling of AI applications across any infrastructure, including on-premises, edge and cloud. Learn more at www.run.ai .

GCSU pre-med mentoring program has 100% application success rate to medical school

Full text: MILLEDGEVILLE, Ga., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- They say going to college is like drinking from a water fountain—in medical school, a fire hose.
At Georgia College & State University, a group of pre-med students already know what it's like to drink from a hose and withstand the deluge.
They have a mentor by their side.
Dr. Ashok Hegde is the William Harvey Endowed Professor of Biomedical Science at Georgia College. In 2016, he took over the university's pre-med mentorship program from Dr. Kenneth Saladin, who wanted to better equip tomorrow's medical students.
The results of Saladin's vision have been nothing short of astounding.
Since the program started in 2009, every student who applied to medical school has been accepted.
Every single one, about 140 in 14 years.
That's unusual.
But so is the mentorship itself. Pre-Med advising at most universities generally means one meeting and a brochure.
"There's not a program like this in Georgia or anywhere in the country," Hegde said. "As far as I can tell, there is not a comparable program anywhere. There are varying degrees of pre-med advising but not pre-med mentoring. There's a huge difference."
"It's not about giving them a little bit of information," he said. "It's about actually preparing them with all the skills that they require. I don't leave anything to chance."
Junior biology major and pre-med student Carter Coursey of Loganville, Georgia, wanted to be a doctor since high school. He hopes to become a dermatologist or orthopedic surgeon.
Like so many other pre-med students before him, however, Coursey wasn't sure he was good enough. What if he messed up the school's 100% application rate?
But there's something special about having a mentor on your side.
Someone who believes in you and helps you believe in yourself.
It creates confidence. Now, Coursey knows he'll make it.
"There's been many times in a class, when I've been struggling with a topic, I think, 'This is hard,'" he said. "There are other majors I could do that are easier than this, and I think, 'Do I want to do this? Can I do this?'"
"But when you have someone like Dr. Hegde in your corner, you say, 'I've got this,'" Coursey said. "He's definitely lowered my anxiety because I feel like I'm more prepared. This seminar makes me feel like I can succeed in med school."

Full text: JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ – Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (NYSE: FNF) ("FNF" or the "Company"), a leading provider of title insurance and transaction services to the real estate and mortgage industries and a leading provider of insurance solutions serving retail annuity and life customers and institutional clients through FNF's wholly-owned subsidiary, F&G Annuities & Life, Inc. ("F&G"), today announced that its Board of Directors has set the record date, the distribution ratio and the expected distribution date for the pro rata distribution of approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of common stock of F&G to FNF shareholders. Following the distribution, FNF will retain control of F&G through an approximately 85% equity ownership stake.   
The record date for determining the FNF shareholders entitled to receive shares of F&G common stock in the distribution will be the close of business on November 22, 2022.
FNF shareholders will receive 68 shares of F&G common stock for every 1,000 shares of FNF common stock held as of the close of business on the record date. The distribution will be made in book-entry form. FNF expects the distribution to occur on December 1, 2022. FNF shareholders will not be required to take any action in order to receive the F&G distribution, meaning that FNF shareholders will not have to surrender or exchange any shares of FNF common stock in order to receive F&G common stock.
The distribution of shares of F&G common stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares) will be treated as a taxable distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any holder of record who sells their shares of FNF common stock on or before the distribution date of December 1, 2022 will be selling their entitlement to shares of F&G common stock to the buyer of their shares of FNF common stock. Holders are encouraged to consult with their financial and tax advisors regarding consequences of buying, selling or holding any securities, including those described in this news release.
Currently, there is no trading market for shares of F&G common stock. F&G is seeking to list its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") under the symbol "FG" subject to its being in compliance with all applicable listing standards on the date it begins trading on the NYSE. F&G intends to satisfy all the requirements for that listing. The Company expects that F&G common stock will commence trading on a "when-issued" basis on the NYSE under the symbol "FG WI" one business day prior to the record date. "Regular-way" trading of F&G common stock on the NYSE is expected to begin on December 1, 2022 under the symbol "FG". Following the separation and distribution, FNF will continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol "FNF."
Completion of the distribution of F&G shares to FNF shareholders is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including that a registration statement on Form 10 filed by F&G with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is declared effective.  F&G Annuities & Life, Inc.'s registration statement on Form 10, including amendments thereto, can be found at  www.sec.gov .

Full text: - The initiative will support organizations such as United Nations Development Programme, Sustainable Energy for All, Net Zero Atlantic, Miyakojima City Government, and Environment Without Borders Foundation for this IBM Sustainability Accelerator environmental cohort
- IBM will donate $30M worth of services by 2023 through the IBM Sustainability Accelerator program

ARMONK, N.Y. and SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced today at COP27 the new members of its global pro bono social impact program, the IBM Sustainability Accelerator . This program applies IBM technologies, such as hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence, and an ecosystem of experts to enhance and scale projects focused on populations vulnerable to environmental threats, including climate change. All new members will focus on accelerating clean energy projects. IBM has previously announced it plans to select five organizations for this program each year and expects to provide $30 million worth of services by the end of 2023.
According to the International Energy Agency, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, disruptions to global supply chains, and diversion of fiscal resources to keep food and fuel prices affordable, have affected the pace of progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 7) of ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy by 2030.
"With the IBM Sustainability Accelerator, we are convening experts and using innovative technologies to help tackle the toughest environmental challenges our planet faces; and transitioning to clean energy is a critical step right now," said Justina Nixon-Saintil, Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility and ESG at IBM. "With this new cohort, helping marginalized communities get just and equitable access to sustainable energy resources not only helps the world achieve the goal of UN SDG7, but can help in the larger global energy transition."
 
After evaluating more than 100 submissions from around the world, IBM selected these organizations to become the clean energy cohort of the program:
- United Nations Development Programme :  UNDP is working with IBM to increase access to sustainable, affordable and reliable energy in African countries, focusing on those furthest left behind. The goal is to forecast electricity access and develop the 'clean electricity equity index' to better guide policy and investment decisions, using UNDP's technical knowledge and IBM's artificial intelligence and geospatial analytics .
- Sustainable Energy for All :  IBM is working with Sustainable Energy for All to build an intelligent model to project energy needs based on current and future human activity. This model will be designed to help to address key development challenges (e.g., lack of energy access and poor healthcare) and support the development of robust infrastructure planning, such as electrification plans. IBM machine learning and IBM Cloud technology and expertise will be used to build and scale open-access datasets and an energy needs model using temporal and spatial data. Kenya and India are being explored as the first regions to pilot the model .
- Net Zero Atlantic : Net Zero Atlantic is collaborating with IBM to create an interactive digital tool that will geospatially display environmental and socioeconomic impacts of possible energy system futures for Nova Scotia. Ultimately, the goal is for Indigenous communities in Nova Scotia to leverage advanced modeling capabilities to inform their input into energy and development planning. The tool aims to be easy-to-use, locally relevant and time efficient. It will be designed to produce easy-to-understand visual results using IBM technology such as the IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite and IBM Cloud .
- Miyakojima City Government : The Miyakojima City Government is working with IBM to support the development of a renewable energy strategy including a microgrid on Miyakojima Island, a distant community facing severe climate issues due to typhoons in Japan, with the goal of helping their residents, who rely on a clean local environment for the tourist industry and agriculture. Miyakojima City Government and IBM will collaborate to leverage technologies such as IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite weather data and IBM Cloud to model electricity demand and advise energy infrastructure development .
- Environment Without Borders Foundation : Environment Without Borders Foundation's collaboration with IBM will be aimed to develop a platform to forecast, track, and communicate clean energy usage options in Egypt. The goal is to enable resilient and sustainable infrastructure and operations for clean energy in Egypt, helping residents of remote villages for whom energy is currently both expensive and unreliable. The clean energy management platform will leverage IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite and IBM Cloud .
The selection process considered the applicant's commitment to support communities who are especially vulnerable to environmental threats, its ability to increase access to affordable clean energy services, its strategic focus and transparency on measurement and reporting, among others.
About IBM Sustainability Accelerator

Revenue growth of 17% in Water Direct & Water Exchange, 11% in Water Refill & Water Filtration, and 47% in Water Dispensers
TAMPA, Fla., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - Primo Water Corporation (NYSE: PRMW) (TSX: PRMW) (the "Company" or "Primo"), a leading provider of sustainable drinking water solutions in North America and Europe, today announced its results for the third quarter ended October 1, 2022.
(Unless stated otherwise, all third quarter 2022 comparisons are relative to the third quarter of 2021; all information is in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP reconciliations presented on the exhibits to this press release)
  THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS - Revenue increased 6% to $585 million compared to $551 million (increased 10% excluding the impact of foreign exchange), driven by revenue growth of 17% in Water Direct / Water Exchange, 11% in Water Refill / Water Filtration, and 47% in Water Dispensers, partially offset by the exit from our North American single use bottled water retail business and foreign exchange headwinds.
- Reported net income and net income per diluted share were $1.3 million and $0.01, respectively, compared to reported net income and net income per diluted share of $18 million and $0.11, respectively. Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share were flat compared to the prior year, at $36 million and $0.22, respectively.

"During the quarter we continued to execute our differentiated Water Your Way platform, and despite near record inflation, we delivered strong revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth. Our investment thesis remains intact with a portfolio of leading water solutions across multiple channels and geographies, strong consumer tailwinds, and a compelling financial profile. The continued investment in our digital platforms, increased connectivity of dispenser sales to our water solutions, and continued optimization of our route-based operations provides a strong foundation to achieve our long-term growth targets," said Tom Harrington, Primo's Chief Executive Officer.
"As a result, we are maintaining our 2024 outlook for high single-digit annual organic revenue growth and are increasing our 2024 annualized Adjusted EBITDA outlook to approximately $530 million dollars," said Mr. Harrington.

THIRD QUARTER GLOBAL PERFORMANCE - Revenue increased 6% to $585 million compared to $551 million (increased by 10% excluding the impact of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by revenue growth of 17% in Water Direct / Water Exchange, 11% in Water Refill / Water Filtration, and 47% in Water Dispensers, partially offset by the exit from our North American single use bottled water retail business and foreign exchange headwinds. Revenue growth by channel is tabulated below:

- Gross profit increased 13% to $348 million compared to $308 million. Gross margin increased 400 bps to 60% compared to 56%, driven by price increases, volume growth in water direct and additional water exchange locations, partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds.
- SG&A expenses increased 13% to $297 million compared to $264 million. The increase was driven by higher route operations costs in labor, fuel and freight to support volume and revenue growth, in addition to higher unit prices due to inflation.
- Reported net income and net income per diluted share were $1.3 million and $0.01, respectively, compared to reported net income and net income per diluted share of $18 million and $0.11, respectively. Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share were flat compared to the prior year, at $36 million and $0.22, respectively.
- Adjusted EBITDA increased 10% to $117 million compared to $106 million, driven primarily by price increases, resilient consumer demand across our customer base and effective expense management. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 20.0% for the quarter.
- Net cash provided by operating activities of $93 million, less $74 million of capital expenditures and additions to intangible assets, resulted in $19 million of free cash flow, or $21 million of adjusted free cash flow (adjusting for the items set forth on Exhibit 7), compared to adjusted free cash flow of $47 million in the prior year.

THIRD QUARTER REPORTING SEGMENT PERFORMANCE North America
- Revenue increased 8% to $447 million driven by revenue growth of 19% in Water Direct / Water Exchange, and 12% in Water Refill / Water Filtration driven by customer acquisitions and retention, partially offset by the exit from our single use bottled water retail business.

ABOUT PRIMO WATER CORPORATION Primo Water Corporation is a leading pure-play water solutions provider in North America and Europe and generates approximately $2.1 billion in annual revenue. Primo operates largely under a recurring razor/razorblade revenue model. The razor in Primo's revenue model is its industry leading line-up of sleek and innovative water dispensers, which are sold through retailers and online at various price points. The dispensers help increase household penetration which drives recurring purchases of Primo's razorblade offering. Primo's razorblade offering is comprised of Water Direct, Water Exchange, and Water Refill. Through its Water Direct business, Primo delivers sustainable hydration solutions across its 21-country footprint direct to the customer's door, whether at home or to businesses. Through its Water Exchange and Water Refill businesses, Primo offers pre-filled and reusable containers at approximately 14,000 locations, water dispenser sales at approximately 10,000 locations and water refill units at approximately 24,000 locations, respectively. Primo also offers water filtration units across its 21-country footprint.
Primo's water solutions expand consumer access to purified, spring, and mineral water to promote a healthier, more sustainable lifestyle while simultaneously reducing plastic waste and pollution. Primo is committed to its water stewardship standards and is proud to partner with the International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) in North America as well as with Watercoolers Europe (WE), which ensure strict adherence to safety, quality, sanitation and regulatory standards for the benefit of consumer protection.
Primo is headquartered in Tampa, Florida (USA). For more information, visit www.primowatercorp.com .
Non-GAAP Measures To supplement its reporting of financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), Primo utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures.  Primo excludes from GAAP revenue the impact of foreign exchange to separate its impact from Primo's results of operations.  Primo also utilizes Adjusted net income (loss), Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to separate the impact of certain items from the underlying business.  Because Primo uses these adjusted financial results in the management of its business, management believes this supplemental information is useful to investors for their independent evaluation and understanding of Primo's underlying business performance and the performance of its management.  Additionally, Primo supplements its reporting of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations determined in accordance with GAAP by excluding additions to property, plant and equipment and additions to intangible assets to present free cash flow, and by excluding the items identified on the exhibits hereto to present adjusted free cash flow, which management believes provides useful information to investors in assessing our performance, comparing Primo's performance to the performance of the Company's peer group and assessing the Company's ability to service debt and finance strategic opportunities, which include investing in Primo's business, making strategic acquisitions, paying dividends, and strengthening the balance sheet. With respect to the Company's expectations of its future performance, the Company's reconciliations of Q4 2022 and full year 2022 Adjusted EBITDA and 2024 Adjusted EBITDA are not available, as the Company is unable to quantify certain amounts to the degree of precision that would be required in the relevant GAAP measures without unreasonable effort. These items include taxes, interest costs that would occur if the Company issued debt, and costs to acquire and/or sell a business if the Company executed such transactions, which could significantly affect our financial results. These items depend on highly variable factors and any such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. Primo expects the variability of these factors to have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on the Company's future GAAP financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures described above are in addition to, and not meant to be considered superior to, or a substitute for, Primo's financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this earnings announcement reflect management's judgment of particular items, and may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Safe Harbor Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 conveying management's expectations as to the future based on plans, estimates and projections at the time Primo makes the statements. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and Primo cautions you that several important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statement. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding future financial and operating trends and results (including Primo's outlook on fourth quarter and full year 2022 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA and Primo's multi-year growth algorithm), and related matters. The forward-looking statements are based on assumptions regarding management's current plans and estimates. Management believes these assumptions to be reasonable, but there is no assurance that they will prove to be accurate.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in this press release include, among others: financial condition and results of operations; Primo's ability to compete successfully in the markets in which it operates; fluctuations in commodity prices and Primo's ability to pass on increased costs to its customers or hedge against such rising costs, and the impact of those increased prices on its volumes; Primo's ability to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with its suppliers; Primo's ability to manage supply chain disruptions and cost increases related to inflation; Primo's ability to manage its operations successfully; currency fluctuations that adversely affect the exchange between currencies including the U.S. dollar, the British pound sterling, the Euro and the Canadian dollar; the impact on Primo's financial results from uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic conditions, including inflation and interest rates; any disruption to production at Primo's manufacturing facilities; Primo's ability to maintain access to its water sources; the impact of climate change on Primo's business; Primo's ability to protect its intellectual property; the seasonal nature of Primo's business and the effect of adverse weather conditions; the impact of national, regional and global events, including those of a political, economic, business and competitive nature; the impact of COVID-19, related government actions and Primo's strategy in response thereto on our business; Primo's ability to fully realize the potential benefit of transactions or other strategic opportunities that it pursues; Primo's ability to realize cost synergies of its acquisitions due to integration difficulties and other challenges; Primo's exposure to intangible asset risk; Primo's ability to meet its obligations under its debt agreements, and risks of further increases to its indebtedness; Primo's ability to maintain compliance with the covenants and conditions under its debt agreements; fluctuations in interest rates, which could increase Primo's borrowing costs; Primo's ability to recruit, retain and integrate new management; Primo's ability to renew its collective bargaining agreements from time to time on satisfactory terms; compliance with product health and safety standards; liability for injury or illness caused by the consumption of contaminated products; liability and damage to Primo's reputation as a result of litigation or legal proceedings; changes in the legal and regulatory environment in which Primo operates; Primo's ability to adequately address the challenges and risks associated with its international operations and address difficulties in complying with laws and regulations including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010; the impact on Primo's tax obligations and effective tax rate arising from changes in local tax laws or countries adopting more aggressive interpretations of tax laws; disruptions in Primo's information systems; Primo's ability to securely maintain its customers' confidential or credit card information, or other private data relating to Primo's employees or the Company; Primo's ability to maintain its quarterly dividend; or credit rating changes.
The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures, including but not limited to risk factors contained in Primo's Annual Report on Form 10-K and its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, as well as other filings with the securities commissions. Primo does not undertake to update or revise any of these statements considering new information or future events, except as expressly required by applicable law.

(a) The tax effect for adjusted net income is based upon an analysis of the statutory tax treatment and the applicable tax rate for the jurisdiction in which the pre-tax
adjusting items incurred and for which realization of the resulting tax benefit (if any) is expected. A reduced or 0% tax rate is applied to jurisdictions where we do not
expect to realize a tax benefit due to a history of operating losses or other factors resulting in a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets.


(b)  GAAP diluted weighted average common shares outstanding were used for the three months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021. The nine months
ended  October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 include the impact of dilutive securities of 932 and 1,734, respectively.  These dilutive securities were excluded from
GAAP diluted weighted average common shares outstanding due to net loss from continuing operations reported in those periods.

Full text: BERKELEY, Calif., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Creator of the world's most sustainable commercial coffee roaster, Bellwether Coffee , today announced the launch of two new software enabled solutions: Bellwether Hub and Bellwether On-Demand. The Hub is designed to enable small-batch electric roasting for high volume coffee businesses. On-Demand provides access to high-quality, sustainable Bellwether roasted coffee for any business through the Bellwether Roaster Network, making ethically sourced and sustainably roasted coffee more accessible than ever before.
About Bellwether Hub
The Bellwether Hub is a software controlled multi-roaster system that enables small-batch sustainable roasting at scale. Each roaster in the Hub is controlled by a single interface that allows for flexibility to roast multiple SKU's at once, or fulfill large orders across multiple roasters simultaneously. The system's software-powered precision can reproduce identical roasts on any roaster, giving retailers the ability to roast large volume orders with the freshness, quality and consistency of a small batch operation.
Building upon the stand-alone Bellwether Roaster, the Bellwether Hub includes comprehensive software management capabilities in its new Roast Manager. This software enables on-demand roasting, and provides infrastructure to scale operations across any number of roasters and locations, delivering high-volume, small-batch artisan roasted coffee.
The first Hub location is up and running at Bellwether's headquarters in Berkeley, California, where its patented electric and ventless design reduces 87 percent of the carbon footprint from roasting, producing the lowest carbon coffee on the market. 
About Bellwether On-Demand
On-Demand is a cloud network of Bellwether Hubs and Roasters that allows business owners and retailers across the country to access fresh, high-quality, sustainable Bellwether roasted coffee on demand. Users simply visit the  Bellwether On-Demand website and select their preferred coffee (and roast level) from the Bellwether Marketplace, which offers a curated selection of ethically sourced coffees from around the world. Businesses can also create their own custom profile. The order goes directly to a nearby all-electric Bellwether Roaster where it is precision roasted in small, five-pound batches.
Bellwether is launching On-Demand with its Berkeley Hub location and numerous customer locations across the country. The benefits to Bellwether customers in providing a new revenue stream can be significant, according to current Bellwether customer and owner of Latitude Coffee, Daniel Levy.
"The additional revenue that comes from the Bellwether Network is very important to our business because it covers a lot of overhead expenses," said Levy. It covers the days that are a little bit slower. It covers the roaster, and it even covers the green beans we buy for ourselves. It's a consistent revenue stream, and it also helps us be part of the larger Bellwether Community, so there is kind of a belonging to it."
Bellwether is creating a better future for the coffee industry by electrifying coffee roasting and reducing the carbon footprint of coffee. Together the Roaster, Hub, and On-Demand network enable any business to serve coffee "Roasted on a Bellwether" and be part of a more sustainable future for coffee.
"Bellwether's On-Demand and Hub offerings allow us to expand the ways in which we help people scale their businesses, all the while furthering our mission to electrify coffee roasting," said Bellwether Coffee Founder, Ricardo Lopez. "It really is a win-win –– we're supporting a multitude of business models, but we're also empowering those businesses to drastically reduce their carbon footprint."
About Bellwether Coffee
Bellwether Coffee is on a mission to empower everyone to sustainably source and roast incredible coffee. Founded in 2013, Bellwether created the world's first all-electric, ventless coffee roasting system with the lowest carbon footprint of any roaster. This first-of-its-kind technology allows the best of craft coffee to be recreated by anyone, anywhere in the world, with the touch of a button. Bellwether's community of roasters and growers are creating a better future for the entire coffee industry–one that is sustainable for the environment, equitable for farmers, and accessible to all communities. To date, Bellwether's fleet of roasters have reduced over 3 million pounds of carbon emissions from the coffee industry.

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Yatsen Holding Limited ("Yatsen" or the "Company") (NYSE: YSG) of a class action securities lawsuit.
CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Yatsen investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud. This lawsuit is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities who purchased Yatsen Holding Limited American Depository Shares ("ADS") between November 19, 2020 and March 10, 2022 or acquired Yatsen ADS pursuant or traceable to documents issued in connection with Yatsen's November 2020 initial public stock offering. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team:
https://www.zlk.com/pslra-1/yatsen-holding-loss-submission-form?prid=33492&wire=4
YSG  investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500.
CASE DETAILS: The filed complaint alleges that defendants made false statements and/or concealed that: the registration statement and prospectus used to effectuate the Company's initial public offering ("IPO"), Yatsen and the other named defendants misled investors into believing that Yatsen's most significant brands, Perfect Diary and Little Ondine, were thriving, thereby driving Yatsen's "healthy" top-line growth at the time of its IPO and quarter after quarter thereafter. In truth, however, cosmetic and skincare sales of Perfect Diary and Little Ondine products were declining in the period leading up to (and including at the time of) the IPO and throughout 2021. Moreover, as the truth about Yatsen's business reached the market, the value of the Company's shares declined dramatically, causing Yatsen investors to suffer significant damages.
WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Yatsen during the relevant time frame, you have until November 22, 2022  to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.
NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.
WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases. Our firm has extensive expertise representing investors in complex securities litigation and a team of over 70 employees to serve our clients. For seven years in a row, Levi & Korsinsky has ranked in ISS Securities Class Action Services' Top 50 Report as one of the top securities litigation firms in the United States.

WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in PayPal during the relevant time frame, you have until December 5, 2022  to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

Full text: Over the past decade, the requirements for regulatory qualification of container and package systems have undergone numerous changes. At the same time, novel drug products coming to market have continued to yield new package use cases and designs with unique considerations. CS Analytical has remained at the forefront of these developments, and as part of its commitment to ongoing industry engagement, is launching a webinar initiative to share insights and foster discussion on key topics and trends in life science container and package testing.
CLIFTON, N.J., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- CS Analytical Laboratory, the world's only FDA regulated contract laboratory exclusively dedicated to providing regulatory solutions and qualification testing services specifically for drug product and medical device container systems is excited to announce that it will be launching an educational webinar initiative, with regularly scheduled presentations and Q&A discussions centered on key topics and trends in container and package system regulatory qualification. The first webinar is scheduled for Wednesday, December 7, 2022 at 10:00am through 11:30am EST and will cover "Comprehensive Container & Package System Qualification for Deep and Ultra-Cold Storage Products". This initial webinar will be hosted by Brandon Zurawlow, Chief Scientific Officer for CS Analytical. These webinars are free of charge and attendees may register here.
"Over the past decade, the requirements for regulatory qualification of container and package systems have undergone numerous changes. CS Analytical has remained at the forefront of these developments," commented CS Analytical CEO Brian Mulhall, "As part of our ongoing commitment to industry engagement and education, the webinars are designed to share our experience and insight with clients and foster industry discussion on changing regulatory expectations and best practices."
In today's marketplace, unique products such as cell and gene therapies, mRNA, and some viral vector vaccines are examples where storage temperatures below those of traditional drug products are often required. Package systems that will be holding, shipping and/or storing products at deep and ultra-cold temperatures (below -60° C) can introduce risk and challenges to the integrity of the primary package system due to changes to elastomer viscoelasticity and overall component shrinkage potential. This first webinar will present a clear review of relevant risks, regulatory considerations, and a defined roadmap for generating packaging data for cold storage systems in accordance with USP 1207 Container Closure Integrity and other industry best practices throughout all phases of the product lifecycle, from development to distribution. Key topics to be covered include:
- Package Development
- Compendial USP Tests
- Non-compendial Tests
- Dimensional Analysis
- Capping Line Qualification
- Residual Seal Force
- USP 1207 Headspace
- Method Validation
- Transport Validation
- Clinical Batch CCI
- CCI on Stability
- Control Strategies

Webinar attendees will gain valuable insight into how best to introduce a flexible and scalable program that will comprehensively characterize and address critical concerns for product manufacturers while mitigating risk to the product, business and most importantly, the patient.
About CS Analytical Laboratory
The only FDA regulated, cGMP laboratory dedicated exclusively to the complex world of drug and medical device container and package qualification testing, the CS Analytical Team includes the world's leading experts on all relevant USP and EP requirements and thought leaders and pioneers on CCI (container closure integrity – CCI) testing.

Full text: - Total revenue of $345.8 million up 8% y/y, which is $350.8 million and up 10% y/y on a constant currency basis
- Cost reduction plan drove improved operating leverage – increasing gross margins q/q and generating positive non-GAAP net income and free cash flow in Q3
- Expecting a return to non-GAAP operating income profitability in Q4'22, positioning company to achieve FY23 FCF margin targets as well as full year non-GAAP operating income profitability outlined in three-year plan

NEW YORK, Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --  Wix.com Ltd. (Nasdaq: WIX) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022. In addition, the Company provided its initial outlook for the fourth quarter. Please visit the Wix Investor Relations website at https://investors.wix.com/ to view the Q3'22 Shareholder Update and other materials.
"Wix continues to be the preferred platform for millions globally. Demand for building, maintaining, and growing an online presence remains healthy, driving strong business fundamentals for Wix this quarter," said Avishai Abrahami, Wix Co-founder and CEO. "As the operating environment remains dynamic and uncertainties persist, we focused on carrying out the cost savings plan introduced last quarter, while continuing to execute on strategic initiatives. Through the team's hard work, profitability improved this quarter while we simultaneously made meaningful strides in product innovation."
Lior Shemesh, CFO at Wix, added, "Revenue came in above expectations this quarter as some stability settled in despite macro headwinds. More importantly, we are already seeing leverage and significant impact from our cost reduction plan, implemented earlier this summer. This resulted in a ~280 bps q/q improvement in non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 and sets us up to generate an anticipated $47-50 million of free cash flow (excluding HQ capex) in Q4, which would make it the most profitable quarter on a free cash flow basis in our history. We also expect to return to non-GAAP operating income profitability in Q4, the first time since 2019. We expect this profitability to continue through 2023, positioning us to achieve the FCF margin target outlined in our three-year plan."
" Confident in our ability to generate cash flow, our board authorized a $300 million share repurchase plan, underscoring our commitment to increasing shareholder value and dilution management," said Nir Zohar, President & COO at Wix.
Q3 2022 Financial Results

- Total revenue in the third quarter of 2022 was $345.8 million, up 8% y/y
- Total revenue on a y/y constant currency basis was $350.8 million, up 10% y/y

- Creative Subscriptions revenue in the third quarter of 2022 was $261.1 million, up 8% y/y

- Total bookings on a y/y constant currency basis were $366.5 million, down (2)% y/y
- Total bookings in Q3'21 were up 33% y/y due to our largest ever B2B partnership, creating a difficult y/y comparison to Q3'22

- Creative Subscriptions bookings in the third quarter of 2022 were $269.9 million, down (8)% y/y
- Business Solutions bookings in the third quarter of 2022 were $82.5 million, up 2% y/y
- Total gross margin on a GAAP basis in the third quarter of 2022 was 63%
- Creative Subscriptions gross margin on a GAAP basis was 76%
- Business Solutions gross margin on a GAAP basis was 22%

- Total non-GAAP gross margin in the third quarter of 2022 was 65%
- Creative Subscriptions gross margin on a non-GAAP basis was 78%
- Business Solutions gross margin on a non-GAAP basis was 24%

- GAAP net loss in the third quarter of 2022 was $(47.4) million, or $(0.81) per share
- Non-GAAP net income in the third quarter of 2022 was $3.6 million, or $0.06 per share
- Net cash provided by operating activities for the third quarter of 2022 was $0.3 million, while capital expenditures totaled $22.9 million, leading to free cash flow of $(22.6) million
- Excluding the capex investment associated with our new headquarters office build out, free cash flow for the third quarter of 2022 would have been $4.6 million

Financial Outlook
Our updated outlook reflects foreign exchange, or FX, rates that have created stronger headwinds to results since we last issued guidance.
For Q4, we expect total revenue to be $349 to $354 million, representing approximately 5 - 6% y/y growth.
For the full year, we now expect revenue to grow 9% y/y. This updated full year guidance reflects the impact of FX rates, which worsened through the third quarter and into November. Assuming FX rates remained constant from July, we would expect revenue growth for the full year to be 10%, consistent with the high end of our previous guidance.
We expect to generate positive non-GAAP operating income and FCF (excluding HQ capex) to meaningfully ramp to $47 to $50 million in Q4.
We now expect FCF excluding HQ capex for the full year to be approximately 2% of revenue, within our previous guidance range.  Assuming FX rates remained constant since July, we expect FCF (excluding HQ capex) would be ~3% of revenue for the full year, consistent with the high end of our guidance range last quarter.  This improvement will be driven by a combination of increased leverage from our completed cost reduction plan and lower marketing spend as we refocus on higher-intent users.
Changes in FX rates have had a significant impact on our reported results to date and on our expectations for the full year.  Assuming y/y constant currency rates as of today:
- Our full year total revenue outlook would be ~$20 million higher, or 10-11% y/y growth
- Our full year total bookings outlook would be ~$43 million higher
- Our full year free cash flow (excluding HQ capex), would be ~$43 million higher or ~5% of revenue, consistent with the high end of the range provided in May

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Operating Metrics
To supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S.  GAAP,  Wix uses the following non-GAAP financial measures:   bookings,  cumulative cohort bookings, bookings on a constant currency basis, revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin,  non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, free cash flow, free cash flow, as adjusted, free cash flow margins, non-GAAP R&D expenses, non-GAAP S&M expenses, non-GAAP G&A expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP cost of revenue expense, non-GAAP financial expense, non-GAAP tax expense (collectively the "Non-GAAP financial measures"). Measures presented on a constant currency or foreign exchange neutral basis have been adjusted to exclude the effect of y/y changes in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Bookings is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by adding the change in deferred revenues and the change in unbilled contractual obligations for a particular period to revenues for the same period. Bookings include cash receipts for premium subscriptions purchased by users as well as cash we collect from business solutions, as well as payments due to us under the terms of contractual agreements for which we may have not yet received payment. Cash receipts for premium subscriptions are deferred and recognized as revenues over the terms of the subscriptions. Cash receipts for payments and the majority of the additional products and services (other than Google Workspace) are recognized as revenues upon receipt. Committed payments are recognised as revenue as we fulfill our obligation under the terms of the contractual agreement. Non-GAAP gross margin represents gross profit calculated in accordance with GAAP as adjusted for the impact of share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and amortization, divided by revenue.  Non-GAAP operating income (loss) represents operating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP as adjusted for the impact of share-based compensation expense, amortization, acquisition-related expenses and sales tax expense accrual and other G&A expenses (income). Non-GAAP net income (loss) represents net loss calculated in accordance with GAAP as adjusted for the impact of share-based compensation expense, amortization, sales tax expense accrual and other G&A expenses (income), amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs and acquisition-related expenses and non-operating foreign exchange expenses (income). Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share represents non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by the weighted average number of shares used in computing GAAP loss per share. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow, as adjusted, represents free cash flow further adjusted to exclude capital expenditures associated with our new headquarters. Free cash flow margins represent free cash flow divided by revenue. Non-GAAP cost of revenue represents cost of revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP as adjusted for the impact of share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and amortization. Non-GAAP R&D expenses represent R&D expenses calculated in accordance with GAAP as adjusted for the impact of share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and amortization. Non-GAAP S&M expenses represent S&M expenses calculated in accordance with GAAP as adjusted for the impact of share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and amortization. Non-GAAP G&A expenses represent G&A expenses calculated in accordance with GAAP as adjusted for the impact of share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and amortization. Non-GAAP operating expenses represent operating expenses calculated in accordance with GAAP as adjusted for the impact of share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and amortization. Non-GAAP financial expense represents financial expense calculated in accordance with GAAP as adjusted for unrealized gains of equity investments, amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs and non-operating foreign exchange expenses. Non-GAAP tax expense represents tax expense calculated in accordance with GAAP as adjusted for provisions for income tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments.
The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with  GAAP.  The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons.  The Company believes that these measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making.
For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the reconciliation tables provided below. The accompanying tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. The Company is unable to provide reconciliations of free cash flow, free cash flow, as adjusted, cumulative cohort bookings, non-GAAP gross margin, and non-GAAP tax expense to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort because items that impact those GAAP financial measures are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted.  Such information may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future financial results.
Wix also uses Creative Subscriptions Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) as a key operating metric. Creative Subscriptions ARR is calculated as Creative Subscriptions Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) multiplied by 12. Creative Subscriptions MRR is calculated as the total of (i) all active Creative Subscriptions in effect on the last day of the period, multiplied by the monthly revenue of such Creative Subscriptions, other than domain registrations in effect on the last day of the period; (ii) the average revenue per month from domain registrations; (iii) monthly revenue from other partnership agreements.

Solar Power Market In India: Segmentation Analysis
- By End-user
- Utility 
- The solar power market share growth in India by the utility segment will be significant during the forecast period. Over the last few decades, a utility-scale solar power plant has been delivering clean and steady energy. When the prices of power generated by fossil fuels are high during peak demand periods, it provides the benefit of stable electricity pricing. It can also be stored in energy storage systems and used when no sunshine is available. These reasons will drive the country's adoption of utility-scale solar power.

DALLAS, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- SWK Holdings Corporation (Nasdaq : SWKH ) ("SWK " or the "Company"), a life science focused specialty finance company catering to small- and mid-sized commercial-stage companies, today provided a business update and announced its financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022.
"The third quarter was a productive period at SWK with three financings closed, progress towards improving our capital structure, a leadership transition, and further strengthening and development of our team," stated Jody Staggs, President and Interim CEO of SWK. "Importantly we've done this while maintaining focus on our core mission of being the leader in custom financings for small and mid-sized commercial-stage life science companies. Our focus is driving results as our total investment assets are at an all-time high while our 17.5% realized yield demonstrates attractive pricing."
Mr. Staggs continued, "We believe SWK's solutions are well positioned for the current market environment with many innovative life science companies finding it difficult to raise equity capital. Our deal pipeline is strong with a balance of first lien loan and royalty opportunities. In order to capitalize on this attractive opportunity, we are evaluating responsibly adding leverage to our balance sheet, which will provide additional dry powder and optimize our cost of capital. Our ongoing 10b-5 program reflects the Board of Director's confidence in our strategy and financial position and illustrates our ongoing commitment to accretive capital deployment."
"Looking ahead, our strategy will remain focused on identifying companies, entrepreneurs, and intellectual property to which our financing structures are well suited and where we believe strong risk-adjusted returns are likeliest to be achieved. We believe this strategy will drive value creation for SWK, translating to solid returns for our shareholders."
Third  Quarter 2022 Financial Results
For the third quarter 2022, SWK reported total revenue of $13.6 million, a 42.4% increase compared to $9.6 million for the third quarter 2021. The $4.0 million increase in revenue was primarily due to $5.0 million of milestone revenue related to Enteris' License Agreement with Cara received during the three months ended September 30, 2022, which did not occur during the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in revenue was partially offset by a $0.9 million net decrease in Finance Receivables segment revenues. The decrease in Finance Receivables segment revenue was due to a $1.3 million net decrease in royalty income primarily due to the achievement of return premiums that caused a step down in royalty rates, which was partially offset by a net increase of $0.4 million in interest and fees earned on finance receivables.
Income before taxes for the quarter was $8.6 million compared to $2.8 million for the same period the previous year, an increase of 195%. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to a $4.9 million increase in income from our Pharmaceutical Development segment and $1.8 million of other income, net on the change in fair value of our warrant assets and marketable investments. The increase was partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in revenues from our Finance Receivables segment and a $0.8 million increase in general and administrative expense.
GAAP net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, increased 195% to $6.6 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, from $2.2 million, or $0.17 per diluted share for the third quarter 2021.
For the third quarter 2022, non-GAAP adjusted net income was $8.3 million, a 94.8% increase from $4.3 million for the third quarter 2021. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the Finance Receivables segment was $6.0 million, a 22.3% decrease from $7.7 million for the third quarter 2021.
During the last twelve-month period, there were $112.8 million of loan repayments and royalty paydowns, which were partially offset by $93.0 million of new and existing investment funding. As a result, income-producing assets (defined as finance receivables and corporate debt securities) totaled $213.1 million as of September 30, 2022. This is an 8.6% increase compared with income-producing assets of $196.3 million as of September 30, 2021. Total investment assets, which include income-producing assets plus equity-linked securities, totaled $222.2 million as of September 30, 2022, compared to the September 30, 2021, total investment assets of $206.3 million.
Book value per share was $21.62 as of September 30, 2022, compared to $20.36 as of September 30, 2021. Non-GAAP tangible financing book value per share totaled $19.14 as of September 30, 2022, a 9.4% increase from $17.50 as of September 30, 2021. Management views non-GAAP tangible financing book value per share as a relevant metric to value the Company's core finance receivable business. Non-GAAP tangible financing book value per share removes the value of the deferred tax assets and Enteris net asset value.
Tables detailing SWK's financial performance for the third quarter 2022 are below.
Portfolio Status
SWK closed three loans during the quarter, deploying $46.0 million with another $11.5 million in unfunded commitments.  We believe the two $25.0 million transactions closed during the quarter demonstrate that SWK's platform can add value to larger borrowers. 
- $7.5 million senior secured credit facility with Exeevo, a provider of modern technology for life sciences organizations to revolutionize customer and patient experiences. $5.0 million was funded at close.
- $25.0 million senior secured credit facility to Aziyo Biologics (Nasdaq: AZYO), a commercial-stage regenerative medicine company. $21.0 million was funded at close.
- $25.0 million senior secured credit facility to MedMinder, a leading connected pharmacy care solution for seniors and polypharmacy patients. $20.0 million was funded at close.

For the third quarter 2022, the realized yield of the finance receivables portfolio was 17.5%, versus 18.8% for the same period the previous year. The realized yield is inclusive of all fees, including all realized unamortized fees, amendment fees, and prepayment fees, and is calculated based on the simple average of finance receivables at the beginning and end of the period. The realized yield is greater than the effective yield due to actual cash collections being greater than modeled.

Passcode: 10172367

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release includes non-GAAP adjusted net income, non-GAAP finance receivable segment net income, and non-GAAP tangible financing book value per share, which are metrics that are not compliant with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP).
Non-GAAP adjusted net income is adjusted for certain items (including (i) changes in the fair-market value of public equity-related assets and SWK's warrant assets as mark-to-market changes are non-cash, (ii) income taxes as the Company has substantial net operating losses to offset against future income, (iii) changes in the fair-market value of contingent consideration associated with the Enteris acquisition as these changes are non-cash, and (iv) depreciation and amortization expenses, primarily associated with the Enteris acquisition.
In addition to the adjustments noted above, non-GAAP finance receivable segment net income also excludes Enteris operating losses.
Non-GAAP tangible financing book value per share excludes the deferred tax asset, intangible assets, goodwill, Enteris PP&E, and contingent consideration associated with the Enteris transaction. Adjusted return on tangible financing book value is calculated by dividing finance receivables segment adjusted non-GAAP net income by tangible financing book value.
These non-GAAP measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies in our industry, as other companies may define such measures differently. Management believes that these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends and provides useful additional information relating to our operations and financial condition. The company encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand its business. Non-GAAP financial results are reported in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, non-GAAP financial measures, even if similarly titled, may not be calculated in the same manner by all companies, and therefore should not be compared.

Full text: Awards for achievements in leadership and innovation given in seven categories
TEL AVIV, Israel, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- The Global Wellness Summit (GWS), the most prestigious conference on the $4.4 trillion business of wellness, wrapped up yet another successful Summit in Tel Aviv last week. This year's in-person conference attracted over four hundred delegates from the wellness, medical, scientific, tech, academic, hospitality and investment worlds to explore the dramatically different and bright future for wellness and preventative health that lies ahead. A photo gallery with highlights of the Summit can be viewed here, while the "Summit on Demand" Playlist is available for pre-order now.
"This year's theme – Open Minds. Open Hearts. Open for Business. – reflected our desire to openly and honestly look at the wellness industry on a global scale and offer the kind of out-of-the-box thinking that helps leaders better envision the future for their businesses," said Nancy Davis, GWS chief creative officer and executive director. "This year's Global Wellness Award honorees, Shark Tank of Wellness finalists and Call for Innovation award winner represent this kind of thinking."
Global Wellness Awards
This year, the Summit announced a new award, the Bennett Family Award for Collaboration in the Science of Wellness. Endowed and presented by Bija Bennett, YubiHealth chief wellness officer, the new award recognizes individuals working to merge science and wellness for the advancement of human health. Presented by Bennett, the award went to Professor Alon Chen, President of the Weizmann Institute of Science, and Juan de Pablo, Executive VP for Science, Innovation, National Laboratories and Global Initiatives at the University of Chicago. "This pair collaborated on research that will no doubt have significant implications for how wearables can powerfully influence the future of women's health and help improve our understanding of the consequences of stress," said Bennett when presenting the award.
The Leader in Innovation Award was presented to Rick Stollmeyer, founder of MindBody, by Josanna Gaither, Executive Director, Spa Channel & Education, Natura Bisse, the award sponsor. Stollmeyer created MindBody, the leading experience technology platform for the fitness, wellness, and beauty industries, in his garage, ultimately selling it for $1.9 billion. Stollmeyer emotionally accepted the honor saying, "This conference has helped remind me who I am and is truly changing the world. I'm honored to be part of it."
"Turning abandoned railway tracks into an international destination was no small feat," said GWS Advisory Board Member, Hannah Messerli, PhD, Economic Development Specialist, when honoring this year's Leader in Sustainability. "What this visionary made possible, gives us all hope about how we might, in our own cities and towns, reimagine what public space is really all about, and what it was meant to be." The award went to NYC High Line co-founder, Robert Hammond. Hammond is now turning his innovative thinking to urban wellness in his role as President & Chief Strategy Officer of Therme Group US.
Freddie Moross, Managing Director, myndstream, was the youngest award winner, receiving the Debra Simon Award for Leader in Furthering Mental Wellness. Presented by GWS Advisory Board Member, C. Victor Brick, CEO, Planet Fitness Growth Partners, LLC; Co- Founder, John W. Brick Mental Health Foundation, on behalf of Lauren Wright, Brick said of this next-generation wellness leader: "Not content to simply build his family's extraordinary business—scoring major motion pictures and creating libraries of mindful music—Freddie has, instead, approached music as a tool for healing, a bridge to help people feel included and respected. His impact on neurodiverse communities, especially children, has already rippled through the wellness landscape and is destined to powerfully impact how we see and treat certain mental illness."
The Leading Woman in Wellness Award went to industry luminary Sue Harmsworth, MBE, founder of one of the most iconic global spa brands, ESPA. Harmsworth spent five decades shaping the global spa, global wellness and beauty industries, responsible for designing 500+ spas in 65 countries and is an international legend who has received numerous awards and accolades. "Sue's extraordinary vision and purpose has shaped the modern-day spa industry, something she continues to do to this day," said Ömer Isvan, President of Servotel, presenting the award.
Shark Tank of Wellness Global Student Competition
Anvisha Vora, from Atlanta, Georgia's Savannah College of Art and Design, took first place honors ($5,000) for Heare, a portable wand that uses micro-vibrations on targeted areas of the ear to manage mental well-being and stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system. Kay McCalla, also from the Savannah College of Art and Design, took second place honors ($3,000) with Aurb, an energetic art piece designed to elevate meditation with color therapy and healing crystals; while third place ($2,000) went to Cornell University's David Austin Jones for Sol Sauna, a floating sauna business concept that will bring a true sauna experience to urban hotspots and natural settings across the United States.
The Shark Tank of Wellness awards were presented by Frank Pitsikalis, Vice President, Strategy at Agilysys; and founder of ResortSuite and fellow judges Amir Alroy, co-founder of Welltech Ventures; Karen Campbell, Business Development Consultant, Chiva-Som International Health Resort; and Aldina Duarte Ramos, Global Director of Well-Being at ACCOR.
Call for Innovation: Wellness & the Metaverse
This year's Call for Innovation focused on wellness and its place in the metaverse. Seven finalists from seven countries (chosen from seventy applicants) were invited to present their innovations to a powerful lineup of judges virtually and in-person at Meta's offices in Tel Aviv, Israel. The winner, Virtuleap, a health and education startup with a mission to elevate cognitive assessment and training using virtual reality and artificial intelligence, took home the award, which was presented by Amir Alroy, Co-Founder, Welltech Ventures. Virtuleap CEO and Co-founder Amir Bozorgzadeh accepted the award, explaining the evolution of their technology involving game developers and neuroscientists working side by side. The award was co-sponsored by Welltech Ventures and Meta in Israel.

The iconic brand recorded the greatest climb in the 14-brand luxury segment, compared with last year's study, with a 25-point rise to a score of 833. Alfa Romeo's eight-place jump from ninth place topped the luxury brand category.
"Quality of our products and customer care are top priorities for Alfa Romeo, and we are genuinely proud to see our efforts have placed the premium brand at number one among luxury brands in the J.D. Power Sales Satisfaction Index," said Larry Dominique, SVP, head of Alfa Romeo North America. "We are focused on continually improving the overall customer experience of owning an Alfa Romeo, and this is a testament to our intense focus on enhancing the dealership component." 
Alfa Romeo's success was complemented by the performances of other Stellantis brands, as Dodge surged 20 points and two places compared with last year, to finish second among mass-market brands. Chrysler also improved – with the latter's 28-point swell marking the largest increase in the mass-market segment.
Jeep® and Ram ranked sixth and seventh, respectively, among mass-market brands, denoting the first time in the study's history that all eligible Stellantis brands achieved scores that ranked above their segment averages.
The J.D. Power 2022 U.S. SSI study measures satisfaction with the sales experience among new-vehicle buyers and those who visit one dealer, only to purchase a vehicle elsewhere. Buyer satisfaction is based on six factors: delivery process, dealer personnel, working out the deal, paperwork completion, dealership facility and dealership website. Rejecter satisfaction is based on five factors: salesperson, price, facility, variety of inventory and negotiation.

Today, for the first time, Pixalate is making public the analysis behind the Trust & Safety Advisory Board's manual review process which identifies the likely target audience (child-directed or general audience) for apps under the COPPA Rule. The Board, composed of qualified educators, has reviewed tens of thousands of mobile & CTV apps to date. Achieving this scale for manually reviewed COPPA compliance data is unprecedented, and it is open to the public through Pixalate's website.
Pixalate's Trust & Safety Advisory Board was founded by Pixalate's Senior Vice President of Public Policy, Ads Privacy and COPPA Compliance, Allison Lefrak, a former Federal Trade Commissioner enforcer.

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The bromhidrosis disease treatment market size is expected to grow by USD 362.76 million from 2021 to 2026. In addition, the growth momentum of the market will accelerate at a CAGR of 8.92% during the forecast period, according to Technavio. The market has been segmented by type geography (North America, Europe, Asia, and Rest of World (ROW) and (apocrine body odor and eccrine body odor). Get a comprehensive report summary that describes the market size and forecast along with research methodology. The FREE sample report is available in PDF format
The rise in the number of patients affected by diabetes and kidney diseases, government awareness programs about the disease, and an increase in healthcare affordability in the US are some of the major factors propelling the market growth. However, factors such as the high cost of treatment, rise in the cost of R&D activities, and lack of knowledge of the disease will hamper the market growth.
More details: https://www.technavio.com/report/bromhidrosis-disease-treatment-market-industry-analysis
Bromhidrosis Disease Treatment Market: Trend
The increasing M&As is a key trend shaping the bromhidrosis disease treatment market . The key vendors are acquiring small vendors to gain access to new products and technologies at low costs. For instance, in February 2022, Ipsen Pharma partnered with Mayoly Spindler to sell its global consumer healthcare business. In May 2022, Pfizer Inc. announced the acquisition of Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. In January 2022, Novartis AG partnered with Alnylam to work on targeted therapy to restore liver function. Thus, the rise in the number of M&A will support the growth of the market in the coming years.
Technavio has identified key trends, drivers, and challenges in the market, which will help vendors improve their strategies to stay ahead of their competitors. Buy Now for detailed information about market dynamics
Bromhidrosis Disease Treatment Market: Type Landscape
By type, the apocrine body odor segment will be a significant contributor to market growth during the forecast period. Apocrine sweat, when discharged, is colorless and odorless. In apocrine bromhidrosis, body odor is caused due to the combination of lipid-rich apocrine gland perspiration with microorganisms on the skin. This leads to the formation of thioalcohol. Thus, the increase in the number of people with apocrine bromhidrosis will drive the growth of the segment during the forecast period.
Bromhidrosis Disease Treatment Market: Geographic Landscape
By geography, North America is going to have lucrative growth during the forecast period. About 38% of the market's overall growth is expected to originate from the region. The US and Canada are the key markets for bromhidrosis disease treatment in North America. The growth of the market in the region is attributed to factors such as rising healthcare expenditures, a well-developed healthcare sector, a large patient population, and government backing for R&D.

Full text: WOONSOCKET, R.I., Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- CVS Health® (NYSE: CVS) is actively preparing for Hurricane Nicole's landfall in Florida. The company's priority is the health and safety of its colleagues, customers and members, and it is committed to providing its communities access to the products and services they need to weather the storm.
As Hurricane Nicole arrives, CVS Health is implementing measures across its businesses to ensure continuity of care:
- CVS Pharmacy is contacting its patients by text message, email and phone to remind them to refill and pick up prescriptions. Stores are also receiving additional supplies of emergency items such as water, batteries and first aid products.
- CVS Caremark, the company's pharmacy benefit manager, is providing one-time emergency refills of a 10-day supply of medication for plan members in impacted areas.
- CVS Specialty patients who are within the emergency area and taking specialty medications will be contacted to discuss alternate delivery arrangements, if needed.
- Aetna's clinical response teams have expanded their engagement with Medicare and Commercial members in potentially impacted areas to ensure member safety and access to emergency services.
- Additionally, Aetna is liberalizing its Resources For Living (RFL) services to ensure individuals and organizations have access to care regardless of whether it is part of their existing benefits. Liberalized services include in-the-moment mental health phone support, a dedicated crisis support website, and community resource information. Individuals and organizations who do not have RFL can call 1-833-327-AETNA, and those with RFL should contact their designated RFL number.
- CVS Health is reaching out to its colleagues who are at risk from the storm to check that they are safe and offer crisis support. Information about community resources and emotional support services is available through the company's employee assistance program.

CVS Pharmacy stores comply with all local evacuation orders. If there are any mandatory closures, impacted stores will reopen as soon as it is safe to do so. If a store is closed for more than one day, the pharmacy's phone lines will be rerouted to a nearby open CVS Pharmacy so patients may continue to access their prescriptions. Patients who have scheduled a COVID-19 or flu vaccination will be notified of any changes to their appointment by email or text message.
CVS Health also recommends the following tips for ensuring prescription needs are met for those potentially impacted by Hurricane Nicole:
- Follow local evacuation orders.  Get to a safe location first and refill your medications at the nearest pharmacy. This allows you to avoid potentially long lines at your local pharmacy, and you won't need to needlessly delay your evacuation.
- Take a waterproof bag with your current medication – even if the bottle is empty.  The information on the prescription label will help pharmacy staff with refill requests. Heat, humidity and sunlight can degrade the effectiveness of medicine, so try to protect it from extreme weather conditions.
- Keep a written record of your current prescriptions on hand. If you are taking several prescription drugs, it's an especially good idea to keep a record of your current medications, dosage and doctor's contact information.

CVS Health remains dedicated to supporting its local communities and is in contact with disaster relief organizations to help communities respond to and recover from the storm.

The market growth will be significant in the chemotherapy segment during the forecast period.

Although the majority of thyroid tumors are curable, about 2%-3% of thyroid cancers are refractory to standard treatments. These types include undifferentiated, highly aggressive, and mostly chemo-resistant tumors and are known as anaplastic thyroid cancer.
- Geography 
- North America
- Europe
- Asia
- Rest Of World (ROW)


37% of the market growth will come from North America during the forecast period. The market growth in North America is primarily attributed to the increased cases of thyroid cancer in the region.

TORONTO, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - As the holiday shopping season rapidly approaches, global IT research and advisory firm Info-Tech Research Group has published its newest blueprint, The Retail Store of the Future . The data-backed research is designed to help business and IT leaders identify and capitalize on the customer shopping journey across the Internet of Things (IoT), store technology, infrastructure, and environments; monetize key customer insights; and transform into a "Smart Store Hub."
"In the last couple of years, retailers have taken extensive steps in setting their stores up to execute e-commerce orders seamlessly,"  says Rahul Jaiswal, principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group. "The main reason for this transformation is the growing demand for easier shopping and quicker delivery. Retailers are working to meet these evolving needs by re-configuring the online-to-offline technology, training staff on new responsibilities, and perfecting curbside pick-up services to be competitive."
With shoppers using technology across several channels to make their purchases, it is crucial for retailers to execute a unified in-store and hybrid customer experience to drive value in today's highly competitive market. This is referred to as "omnichannel," which means increasing the adoption of technology tools and processes within all aspects of an organization. It brings businesses closer to customers by understanding their needs.
"The function of the store is no longer just a channel to display and sell products,"  adds Jaiswal. "Retail environments now present an opportunity to play a far greater role in promoting the brand, driving innovation, fulfilling orders, and much more. The retail store of the future provides an all-in-one connected experience to transform into a 'Smart Store Hub.'"  
Info-Tech suggests organizations follow three steps to capitalize on infrastructure technology and prepare for the future:
- Assess infrastructure integration.
Retailers need to ensure that the right infrastructure is in place to support the technologies. Too many retailers struggle to integrate new and emerging technologies into legacy infrastructure, making the customer experience worse. Often, the best decision is to upgrade the entire system to pave the way for the future.

- Review service-led support models.
Software and infrastructure technology must be continually adapted to keep up with new technology developments. Associations between retailers and technology partners must shift from transactional installments to service-led support.

- Develop a holistic strategy.
Retailers should reconsider all technologies while planning advantage creators. For example, many enterprises do not recognize augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) as vital to their business. However, interest in these areas is accelerating quickly as web 3.0, digital currencies, non- fungible tokens (NFTs), and the metaverse create new prospects for value creation.
Info-Tech also recommends keeping eight best practices in mind as retailers streamline infrastructure and capture the benefits of real-time insights:
- One size does not always fit all.
- Too much complexity leads to waste.
- Deployment takes a significant investment of time and capital.
- Costs are difficult to predict.
- Security must be strong – be prepared for ransomware.
- Back-up frequently.
- Manage and support monitoring services.
- Invest in IT capability at remote sites.

The International Red River Watershed Board to monitor key nutrients to help reduce the impact of harmful blooms in the Red River basin

OTTAWA, ON and WASHINGTON, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - To continue improving water quality in the Red River basin, including downstream in Lake Winnipeg, the governments of Canada and the United States approved four additional water quality objectives to be monitored by the International Red River Watershed Board (IRRWB) following a recommendation by the International Joint Commission (IJC). These additional, non-regulatory water quality objectives are for the key nutrients phosphorus and nitrogen.
Excessive nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen increase the frequency and severity of algal blooms, one of the biggest water quality challenges facing the Red River watershed and Lake Winnipeg.
The Red River travels north from its headwaters in Minnesota and South Dakota, across the international boundary and flows downstream into Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba.
Establishing objectives and targets for phosphorus and nitrogen levels and loads in the Red River, along with the other water quality objectives, allows the IRRWB to identify changes in water quality trends over time; essential information to improve water quality and reduce the occurrence of harmful algal blooms in the basin.
Following work by federal, state and provincial agencies, significant collaboration through the IRRWB and a number of IJC-funded studies which suggested a significant portion of those nutrients entering Lake Winnipeg come from the Red River, the IJC made (in May 2020) the recommendation to governments that they approve these additional nutrients objectives and targets.
Individuals interested in the IRRWB's work should visit their website for more information: ijc.org/en/rrb
Quotes "I want to thank both governments for approving the IJC-recommended objectives for the Red River basin. The monitoring of phosphorus and nitrogen is key to limiting excess nutrients in the basin."
Pierre Béland, Commissioner and Canadian Chair
"This is excellent news that will enable the International Red River Watershed Board to work with all our partners to improve water quality in the Red River basin. I welcome this decision and thank the Board for their continued commitment to ecosystem health in the basin."
Rob Sisson, Commissioner and Acting United States Chair
Quick Facts - The Red River basin occupies substantial portions of North Dakota, northwestern Minnesota, southern Manitoba and a very small portion of northeastern South Dakota. It covers 116,500 square kilometers or 45,000 square miles, excluding the Assiniboine River basin, which joins the Red River at Winnipeg.
- The concentrations, or specific levels of total phosphorus and nitrogen in the water, would best be limited to 0.15 milligrams per liter (0.15 parts per million) and 1.15 mg/l (1.15 ppm), respectively. The loading targets (i.e. amount of nutrients in the river passing by the international boundary) are 1,400 tons/year for phosphorus and 9,525 tons/year for nitrogen.
- In addition to monitoring phosphorus and nitrogen levels, five other water quality objectives were previously established for the Red River and are monitored by the IRRWB. They are: Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Chloride (Cl), Sulphate (SO 4 ), and E. coli.
- The IRRWB's responsibilities are outlined in the Directive to the International Red River Watershed Board.
- The IJC is an independent body established by the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 to help the governments of Canada and the United States prevent and resolve disputes over use of the waters shared by the two countries. It officially designated the IRRWB as an international watershed board in August 2021.

–Eleventh annual Dirty Dogs Contest from pet grooming leader Wahl sheds light on animal adoption, supports rescues–
(See video of winning dogs)
STERLING, Ill., Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Zen  was rescued from a horrendous hoarding case. She arrived at the shelter with mange that required regular medicated baths and severe damage to one of her eyes. After extensive grooming and care, the 6-month-old pup went from sick, to healthy, to spunky in no time. While this happy and relaxed girl is still looking for her forever home, she's well on her way to an enlightened path as her amazing makeover won her the title of America's Top Shelter Dog Makeover in the 11 th annual Dirty Dogs Contest . It's bittersweet stories like Zen's that inspire the contest from pet industry leaders Wahl and Greater Good Charities. By spotlighting the influence grooming can have on dog adoption, and awarding the contest winners with grant money, it's their hope more dogs will find forever homes and live the long, healthy and happy lives that they deserve.
 
About the Dirty Dogs Contest
For the last 11 years, Wahl has been on a mission to support dog adoption by donating pet grooming supplies to rescues and shelters nationwide. Because of these donations, hundreds of thousands of dogs are being transformed and readied for adoption.
Each year, with the help of donated grooming supplies, hundreds of shelters share incredible transformation photos and stories. Ten of the most dramatic doggy makeovers are selected, and public votes determine the top 3 winners.
The Humane Society of Dickson County in Dickson, TN, the rescue organization that saved Zen , will receive a $10,000 grant to further support their efforts. In addition, Brookhaven Animal Rescue League in Brookhaven, MS, the rescue that submitted second place winner Bentley , will receive a $3,000 grant, and third place dog Luna earned $2,000 for National Mill Dog Rescue in Colorado Springs, CO.
"Grooming is essential for all our rescued animals. We've had dogs come in with severe matting, missing fur, hots spots, fleas and ticks; and grooming makes them so much more comfortable," said Deb Walsh, volunteer at the Humane Society of Dickson County, "This $10,000 grant will greatly improve the lives of our current dogs and cats and enable us to save and help so many more."

Full text: Helicoid Industries Inc. is proud to announce it has successfully released three use cases highlighting performance enhancing technology at the CAMX Conference in Anaheim, CA on October 20th, 2022
INDIO, Calif., Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ --The bio inspired Helicoid™ technology enables improved performance of advanced composites, leading to lighter structures, while achieving excellent cost efficiency and sustainability. The deployment of Helicoid™ technology can be realized with no change in raw materials (fiber and resin), and no change in the manufacturing process. Therefore, the benefits are achieved with no supply chain disruption.
The first use case was a collaboration between Helicoid Industries Inc., TPI Composites, Inc. and SAERTEX GmbH (Saerbeck, Germany) focusing on improving the mechanical performance of Electric Vehicle (EV) battery pack underbody protection plates made of innovative E-glass Helicoid™ multiaxial non-crimp fabrics infused with a thermoset resin.
Key mechanical requirements of EV protective enclosures are mainly tailored to resist road impact with the objective of guaranteeing the survivability and integrity of the battery module. Specifically, these requirements include resistance to perforation, reduction of fiber splintering (i.e. high structural integrity) and reduction of deflection under impact. Prototyping and testing with Helicoid™ have demonstrated a 25% higher impact strength and a 20% reduction in the maximum deflection during impact compared to a commercial design at equal weight, using the same fiber type and resin system. These results were primarily achieved by engineering the ply angles of the glass fibres from a conventional quasi-isotropic lay-up to our bio-inspired helicoidal lay-up with tailored stiffness and impact performance. Fiber failure was suppressed upon impact, thus leading to a solution with high structural integrity and an unprecedented potential for both weight and cost savings.
Kevin Veloso, TPI Composites, Inc. Principal Engineer Transportation stated; "Helicoid's fiber architecture technology enables a viable solution for improving/optimizing impact performance. The delay in fiber damage makes the composite laminates more durable and impact resistant. It has been a pleasure collaborating with such great talent at Helicoid and look forward to our mutual success".
The second use case demonstrated that Helicoid™ fibre architecture delivers excellent performance improvements with one of the fastest growing categories of composite materials: fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites. These materials are equally strong and stiff as thermoset composites, but provide improved energy absorption, fatigue resistance, and recyclability. They are also much faster to process. These characteristics make the Helicoid™ technology ideally suitable for mass production. In a collaboration with Mitsui Chemicals Europe GmbH, with the support of Airborne, it was demonstrated that TAFNEX© Carbon/PP laminates, utilizing the Helicoid™ fibre architecture technology achieves >90% higher multi-strike resistance compared to conventional laminate designs. This, along with the healing enabled by Helicoid™ fiber architectures & thermoplastic matrix systems, paves the way for improved cost efficiency and sustainability by achieving 'more with less'.
Green Composites: Enabling natural fibres in loadbearing, damage resistance structures
Helicoid Industries Inc. was awarded the Outstanding Technical Paper Award Winner at the annual CAMX Conference, held in Anaheim from October 17th to October 20th, 2022. The paper, authored by Dr. Lorenzo Mencattelli, Helicoid Industries Managing Director of Technology and Operations, highlights the third use case, and described how natural fiber composites can now be used successfully, where historically they have struggled to find market share in high-volume, high-performance applications for their relatively low performance/cost ratio.
In a collaboration with National University of Singapore, Helicoid Industries has demonstrated that the Helicoid™ technology can be successfully tailored to enhance impact performance of a wide set of natural fiber composites and their hybrids. The study included an in-depth analysis of several Helicoid™ configurations including flax/glass composite hybrids with different flax/glass ratios. Key achievements include the demonstration that Helicoid can greatly outperform 100% glass fiber composites while utilizing 50% of its mass with natural flax fibres, which have >50% lower carbon footprint. Key performance improvements included +60% larger "warning region" before failure, +105% energy storage before peak load, +32% perforation energy and +14% impact strength. This is the first step in establishing biomaterial applications in composite structural parts and a pathway to a more sustainable composites industry.
Dr. Lorenzo Mencattelli, Managing Director of Technology and Operations for Helicoid stated; "natural-fiber composite materials are key to achieving a more sustainable transportation industry. Biomimicry can be an effective tool to enable a more extensive use of natural-fiber composite products in high-performance applications and load-bearing structures. The collaboration with National University of Singapore has demonstrated how Helicoid™ technology can be efficiently shaped to deliver meaningful margins of improvement for both high-end products using natural-fibers UD tape prepreg systems and high-volume applications using flax NCF and a liquid molding process, thus creating an opportunity for technology deployment in a wide range of markets and applications."
ABOUT HELICOID INDUSTRIES
Helicoid Industries is a California based company founded in 2019 by a seasoned team of experts working to commercialize the Helicoid™ biomimetic fiber-reinforced composite technology. Helicoid Industries both licenses the technology to composite producers, as well as produces preform solutions. The Helicoid™ technology emulates the structure found in the Mantis shrimp, which is one of the toughest structures in the world providing incredible impact resistance and weight savings.

New resource features courses and certifications to build skills most in demand by employers today and into the future
RADNOR, Pa., Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Surgent Accounting & Financial Education, a division of KnowFully Learning Group, today at the inaugural Surgent Presents announced the debut of Surgent IQ™ , its online, on-demand learning center focused on skill-building educational courses and certification for current and aspiring accounting, tax and finance professionals.
"The need for upskilling and reskilling is significant and on the rise," said Surgent EVP Liz Kolar. Drawing upon 35+ years in accounting and finance education as well as a modern understanding of the data analytics skills now in demand in the workplace, Surgent IQ courses marry Surgent's ability to deliver engaging instruction with its easy-to-use, on-demand software delivery system. The result is a rich, convenient, and meaningful learning experience for any student at any stage of their career.
Offerings within the Surgent IQ hub include Surgent Interactive courses introduced earlier this year. The "Max the Tax," "Surging Auditors" and "Business Development" series include short, game-based courses to keep accounting, tax and financial professionals engaged while they develop skills and earn Continuing Professional Education (CPE) credit.
"As the accounting industry rapidly evolves, the skills in demand by accounting firms today are more technology-based than ever, with a great focus on data-driven skills such as analytics and visualization," said Liz Kolar, Surgent executive vice president. "Surgent IQ is our answer to this need. With its growing collection of courses that make skill-building easy and convenient, it will serve as an important resource center, helping accounting, tax and finance professionals continue to grow and serve as trusted advisors to their clients."
Featuring storylines and animated characters, the gamified courses task learners with real-world accounting and tax scenarios, such as interviewing clients, making observations and completing forms. Learners receive instant feedback and scores as they progress. This style of learning stimulates critical thinking and increases knowledge retention.
The learning center, which will continue to grow as the industry evolves, also offers data analytics and fraud certifications, and introductory accounting courses.
"The need for upskilling and reskilling is significant and on the rise, as these are subjects that are often not taught at the collegiate level," said Kolar. "We are excited to fill the gap for both individuals and firms seeking this type of education and we look forward to introducing more topics down the road, such as robotics, ESG and DEI, among others."

Microbiome Overview
The term "microbiome" refers to a grouping of microbes and their interactions with the human body. The microbiome is important in human physiology and disease. The interaction of microbes with the human body demonstrates various aspects of human biology. If the microbiome is well understood, it can be used to create personalized medicine tailored to the patient's needs.
As there are currently no approved microbiome drugs on the market, many companies are racing to develop new drugs or aiming to develop therapies that can alter the microbiome for the benefit of human health. Proper microbial flora monitoring has the potential for early disease diagnosis and can thus be used as a treatment strategy for conditions that have proven untreatable with conventional methods.

Microbiome Pipeline Analysis: Drug Profile
B244: AOBiome
AOBiome's B244 is a patented, proprietary topical formulation containing a single live strain of Nitrosomonas eutropha D23, an ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). It metabolizes sweat ammonia to produce nitrite and nitric oxide, both of which have anti-inflammatory and anti-infective properties. The therapeutic drug was created to repopulate the skin microbiome with AOBs, which are naturally present in the body but are removed by most soaps.
Blautix: 4D Pharma
4D Pharma is developing Blautix, an orally administered drug. The drug is in Phase II development for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBD). Blautix is a single-strain human gut commensal bacterium with a unique metabolism that may be used to treat IBS. Blautix consumes gases in the gut that are known to cause bloating, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel frequency. The company completed a successful Phase Ib clinical study of Blautix in IBS patients, and the results were encouraging, according to the company, and provided a solid foundation for moving Blautix into larger clinical studies and further evaluation as a potential treatment for IBS.

Full text: Global Phone services provides critical marketing, compliance, and business intelligence data
SANTA BARBARA, Calif., Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Service Objects, the leading provider of real-time contact data validation solutions, reminds customers of the importance of phone intelligence as the holiday shopping season approaches for retailers. Its GeoPhone Plus service provides critical reverse phone lookup services needed for regulatory compliance and marketing support during this peak selling period.
Statistics show that phone information is often the weak link in business contact data, with over half of numbers captured on web forms being bogus or non-operational, 25% of numbers changing annually, and 2.8 million consumers switching phone providers each year. More importantly, violations of regulations such as the US Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) carry steep fines of up to $1500 per call or text for unsolicited telephone marketing, particularly wireless users, requiring an automated process for detecting when numbers change.
Reverse phone services return contact details, carrier, and other essential phone data for numbers in the US, Puerto Rico, and Canada, with GeoPhone Plus providing this important data for nearly a quarter of a billion wireless numbers as well. They cross-reference US and Canadian name and addresses to append business and consumer phone numbers and provide advanced phone intelligence including carrier, line type, country, and location information.
In addition to providing accurate phone numbers that are vital to connecting with customers and prospects, these products provide key data about them, including appending current phone numbers to existing contacts, backfilling contact records with names and addresses, determining if a phone number can receive an SMS message, and confirming porting dates to avoid privacy and compliance issues.
According to Geoff Grow, Founder and CEO of Service Objects, "Phone intelligence keeps businesses connected, particularly in a world where e-commerce increasingly involves mobile devices, and compliance issues face every business that markets by phone. Our Phone intelligence suite of services offers business-grade solutions that provide industry-leading capabilities in this critical area."
These services support major marketing automation and CRM platforms using convenient API interfaces, and all Service Objects products feature expert installation assistance, available 24/7/365 technical support, and the industry's only financially guaranteed 99.999% uptime. To learn more about Phone Intelligence products or any of Service Objects' contact data quality solutions, or to request a free live demo, please visit our website.
Founded in 2001, Service Objects is the leading provider of contact validation solutions, validating online transactions in real-time, including contact name, address, phone, email, and device. Using Service Objects' global validation and location web services, businesses can identify potentially fraudulent contact records, append additional contact information, and process transactions in a more efficient manner. Service Objects has validated over 5 billion contacts, and major brands such as American Express, Microsoft, and Amazon rely on Service Objects for their data validation needs.

For the first time, the report also includes an audio component featuring the voices of select associates who contributed to the company's progress, providing those who may be visually impaired the opportunity to experience the report. This added audio feature illustrates PepsiCo's continued commitment to evolving its offerings to be more inclusive and accessible.
"DE&I is and will continue to be a competitive advantage for our company, driving our performance, and enabling our sustained growth over the long-term," said Ramon Laguarta, PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO.

- Investing more than $2.9 billion in diverse suppliers over the past three years, – more than 50% of which was spent with women-owned businesses.

- Manzanita Sol, a crisp, refreshing apple soda reminiscent of the flavors of Latin America and the Caribbean, supported some of New York City's most beloved Black and Hispanic-owned food trucks with $10,000 to help further their small businesses.
- Walkers introduced a range of limited-edition crisps reminiscent of iconic flavors of UK restaurants (e.g., 'Madras Curry' inspired by The Radhuni in Edinburgh and 'Chicken Burrito' inspired by Yucca in London) to encourage customers to give back and support their favorite local eateries.
- Doritos Mexico launched a Día de Muertos ad that celebrates love and reaffirms the company's ongoing allyship of the LGBTQ+ community through its #PrideAllYear campaign.


A space for communities to thrive:
- Unlocking opportunities & cultivating future talent through the Graduate and Future Leaders program in Africa that helps women and men advance their skills and careers.
- PepsiCo trained 43 individuals from Nigeria, Ethiopia, and South Africa who participated and graduated from the 18-month program and majority were offered roles within the company upon completion.


- Meeting the needs of local communities  through its Food for Good program that aims to increase access to nutritious food.
- In response to the growing hunger crisis, PepsiCo and the Foundation expanded Food for Good's to 28 countries worldwide with a goal to provide access to nutritious food to 50 million people by 2030 (against a 2021 baseline). Through Food for Good, PepsiCo has delivered more than 245 million meals since 2009, reached 41 million people across the world since 2016, and has partnered with more than 60 nonprofits across 28 countries to ensure the company is implementing local solutions that meet the unique challenges of each community.

- Thousands of turkeys and food assistance to be   donated and   distributed   in Los Angeles, New York, Nashville, Norfolk, Houston, Savannah  and Washington, D.C.
- CMA CGM Group subsidiaries CEVA Logistics and American President Lines (APL) aiding in the transportation of the turkeys and servicing U.S. troops and their families.
- CMA CGM Group is supporting local agriculture and sustainable business practices through all-natural, antibiotic-free turkeys sourced direct from the farm.

NORFOLK, Va., Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The CMA CGM Group, a global player in sea, land, air and logistics solutions, announced today its third annual Giving Across America initiative. This initiative is highlighted by the donation of 10,000 turkeys and more than 3,000 meals to help make celebrating Thanksgiving possible for approximately 130,000 people*.
Distributing  thousands of turkeys across America
Turkey distributions will begin on Saturday, Nov. 12 in Los Angeles, Calif. The distributions will continue in New York (Brooklyn) on Nov. 15; Nashville, Tenn. on Friday, Nov. 18; Norfolk, Va. on Nov. 19 along with hot meals on Sunday, Nov. 20; Houston, Texas on Nov. 21; and Savannah, Ga. on Wednesday, Nov. 23.

Last month, the CMA CGM Group in partnership with Sun Youth, provided 1,000 turkeys along with sustainable shopping bags for families in Montréal, Canada.
Ed Aldridge, President of CMA CGM and American President Lines North America , stated , "At CMA CGM, we are honored to not only demonstrate our commitment to BETTER WAYS of doing business by giving back to our local communities, but to also support America's poultry industry and the farmers who make this holiday possible.

Full text: Prevent Blindness to provide Thyroid Eye Disease (TED) educational materials, promote awareness, and offer unique Art Therapy program for patients and care partners
CHICAGO, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Prevent Blindness, the nation's leading nonprofit eye health and safety organization, has declared Nov. 14-20, 2022, as its third annual "Thyroid Eye Disease Awareness (TED) Week." TED, sometimes called Graves' ophthalmopathy or Graves' Eye Disease, is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system causes inflammation and swelling and stimulates the production of muscle tissue and fat behind the eye.
To help raise awareness and provide free educational content to patients, care partners and healthcare professionals, Prevent Blindness offers TED fact sheets and social media graphics in English and Spanish, and a dedicated webpage. Also available is the "Thyroid Eye Disease" episode of the Focus on Eye Health Expert Series, featuring Prevent Blindness President and CEO Jeff Todd interviewing Sara Wester, MD, FACS, professor of clinical ophthalmology at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, and TED patient Stephen Bander. TED Awareness Week is supported by Horizon Therapeutics, a global biotechnology company focused on rare, autoimmune and severe inflammatory diseases.
Risk factors for TED include:
- Graves' disease
- Low levels of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism)
- Age: Usually affects middle-age adults but can occur at any age
- Gender: Females are affected more than males
- Family history of thyroid eye disease
- Smoking: Smoking increases the risk of thyroid eye disease by 7–8 times, causes thyroid eye disease to have a longer "active phase," and reduces the effectiveness of treatments
- Radioactive iodine therapy: Radioactive iodine has been used to treat hyperthyroidism and Graves' disease. This treatment should be used with caution in people with active thyroid eye disease as it may worsen the condition unless steroids are given at the same time
- Low blood levels of selenium, a dietary mineral.

TED may cause eye pain, double vision, loss of vision, and changes to physical appearance which may negatively impact quality of life. Some TED patients experience depression, anxiety, loss of independence, and reduced self-confidence.
To help address this, the no-cost "Prevent Blindness Art Therapy Program" for people with TED and their care partners, now in its second session, provides participants with the opportunity to create art using a variety of artistic media to express thoughts and feelings. Participants also interact with registered art therapists who tailor the program topics, themes and materials for people affected by TED. Benefits of the Art Therapy program include:
- Art therapy has been shown to help people improve their mental, emotional, and even physical wellness.


- The process of creating art in a group setting can help reduce anxiety and depression, provide a way to express difficult emotions in a creative manner, and reduce isolation, which could be particularly important for people experiencing the challenging symptoms of TED.


- The opportunity to help people build new connections, help themselves, and help others by sharing stories and experiences.


Those interested in participating in the next session may sign up for the Prevent Blindness Art Therapy Program waiting list. This program is supported by funding from Horizon Therapeutics.
"By providing TED patients and their care partners with information and tools they need to understand Thyroid Eye Disease, along with offering the Prevent Blindness Art Therapy Program to help address the mental health impact, we can help to minimize the negative effect that TED often has," said Jeff Todd, president and CEO of Prevent Blindness.

Truck drivers can receive a Super Snack meal and custom trucker hat at Chester's and Love's joint locations, no purchase necessary
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Chester's Chicken, the fresh fried chicken quick-service restaurant concept, in collaboration with Love's Travel Stops, the nation's leading travel stop network, are bringing back Truckersgiving, the annual holiday season celebration that recognizes and appreciates professional drivers for their service. One week before Thanksgiving – on Thursday, Nov. 17 – Chester's and Love's will honor truck drivers with a free Super Snack meal for the first 100 guests at each Chester's located at Love's. Additionally, the first 20 road warriors who show their commercial driver's license at each location will also receive a custom Chester's trucker hat.

"The role of professional drivers remains critical – especially during the holiday season – with the average driver clocking 60 hours of driving in one week," said William Culpepper, vice president of marketing, Chester's Chicken. "We launched the first Truckersgiving with Love's last year, and it was so well received that we had to bring it back in an even bigger way. Truck drivers are some of our best and most loyal customers, so offering this free meal to drivers across the country is our way of saying thank you for their important work."
The Super Snack meal includes two pieces of Chester's signature fried chicken – a leg and a thigh – and a side of potato wedges. Chester's specially marinated and double breaded chicken has bold flavor with a perfect crunch that's a favorite for anyone on the road. Chester's is especially popular with truck drivers and road trippers given its store-in-store concept that spans truck stops and convenience stores.
There are 141 Chester's restaurants found within Love's, spanning 34 states. Roughly 60 professional drivers visit a Love's two to three times in an average week – and the week prior to Thanksgiving is one of the busiest times for truck traffic.
"Professional drivers can't be thanked enough for their hours on the road," said Joe Cotton, vice president of restaurant services, Love's. "Truckersgiving is a new favorite tradition we're proud to host with Chester's Chicken to celebrate our professional truck driver customers and kick off the holiday season."
Professional drivers can claim the Truckersgiving Super Snack meal by stopping by any Chester's restaurant within a Love's during operating hours on Thursday, Nov. 17, and scanning the barcode on their Love's Connect App or by swiping their My Love Rewards Card. Trucker hats will be given out at each joint location to the first 20 truckers who also show their commercial driver's license.

IDTechEx Report Reveals Surging Li-ion Battery Market (Controlled by China)

Full text: BOSTON, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Rapid growth in the Li-ion market is expected over the next ten years. IDTechEx forecast the Li-ion battery market will reach over US$430 billion by 2033. Electric vehicles (EV) and transportation will represent the largest market. By 2033, battery electric cars will constitute over 90% of Li-ion demand, by GWh, by 2030. This will be driven by the increasing adoption of electric vehicles with more stringent emissions targets and goals and as EVs begin to reach cost parity with conventional ICE vehicles.
However, significant market opportunities will still exist in consumer electronics, electronic devices, and stationary energy storage systems. Given the rapid pace of growth, significant investment has been placed on increasing production capacities for Li-ion batteries. While a significant number of announcements and plans are in place for the development of battery supply chains in Europe and North America, China currently dominates. IDTechEx estimate that 70% of Li-ion cells were produced in China in 2021, and though this share will shift to Europe and USA over the next five years, China is still expected to hold over 50% of manufacturing capacity by 2028. A large domestic market for both electric vehicles and stationary storage, and a strategic outlook on the importance of the battery market, have helped foster this strong position.
Growth in the Li-ion industry has occurred despite considerable headwinds over the past year due to high prices and volatility for some key raw materials. Lithium and nickel, in particular, saw substantial price increases over 2021 and 2022, impacting cell and battery prices. This has created a driver for the adoption of lower cost battery technologies such as lithium iron phosphate, which has seen a resurgence in China and is gaining popularity in Europe and America among automakers, as well as in the stationary storage sector. However, a shift to LFP would further consolidate China's leading position with the vast majority of LFP cathode and batteries produced in China. Options, including high-manganese cathodes, high voltage LNMO, and silicon based anodes, are being explored and commercialized in efforts to not only improve performance but reduce costs and supply chain risks.
To learn more about the Li-ion market, technology developments, players, and applications, please see the new IDTechEx report "Li-ion Battery Market 2023-2033: Technologies, Players, Applications, Outlooks and Forecasts".

New offering expected to spur development opportunities globally
BETHESDA, Md., Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Marriott International, Inc., today announced its expansion into apartment-style accommodations with the launch of Apartments by Marriott Bonvoy™. The company is seizing upon growing consumer interest among families and friends seeking more space for stays, propelled by the blending of work and leisure travel, and the desire among younger travelers for wider accommodations options.
Marriott is building upon its 26 years of experience with Marriott Executive Apartments, its serviced-apartment brand in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. With the introduction of Apartments by Marriott Bonvoy, the company expects it will enhance portfolio growth globally and bring the serviced-apartment concept to Marriott guests in the U.S. and Canada.  
"Travelers planning vacations and long business trips today are seeking more choice in accommodations, and the introduction of Apartments by Marriott Bonvoy responds to those trends while offering developers a premium product backed by our trusted name and distribution platform," said Stephanie Linnartz, President, Marriott International. "With Apartments by Marriott Bonvoy, guests will be able to shop a wider array of accommodation options within the Marriott Bonvoy portfolio, growing their loyalty to the portfolio and its range of brand offerings." 
Marriott plans to introduce Apartments by Marriott Bonvoy in the upper-upscale and luxury segments, distinguished from Marriott's existing extended-stay brands, with distinctly designed products that reflect the local neighborhood for independent travelers seeking more space and residential amenities. Apartments by Marriott Bonvoy will feature a separate living room and bedroom, full kitchen, and in-unit washer and dryer, but will be differentiated from Marriott's existing extended-stay brands by not providing certain traditional hotel services such as food and beverage, meeting spaces, and retail. Apartments by Marriott Bonvoy is anticipated to offer developers the flexibility to build new properties or convert existing properties, with a design approach similar to the company's successful Autograph Collection and Tribute Portfolio lodging brands, which offer consumers independent, uniquely distinguished hotel experiences. Apartments by Marriott Bonvoy will be backed by Marriott's powerful reservations engine and Marriott Bonvoy, the company's award-winning travel program with 173 million members.      
Among travel consumers and Marriott Bonvoy members, there is a growing desire for premium accommodations that provide home-like amenities as travelers combine work and leisure trips to reconnect with family and friends. According to Phocuswright research, three of the top five reasons for selecting an apartment-style rental are more room or space, access to a full kitchen and laundry, and home-like feel. 1
Prospective developers can learn more about Apartments by Marriott Bonvoy and all the company's brands on Marriott's development  website.  Offer and sale by prospectus only.

Veteran-founded nutrition company helps charity organization bring the comforts of home to soldiers abroad and to their families back home
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Key Nutrients announced today its partnership with local charity, the Military Support Foundation, to continue providing donations in support of active military personnel deployed overseas and their families at home.
Since 2016, the Military Support Foundation has evolved into a giving tree to the military units it adopts every year, an arrangement that is made before the units are deployed. Over the years, the organization has shipped more than 10,000 meticulously crafted care packages to United States servicemen and women, filled with their favorite comforts from home as well as basic necessities. Back at home, the Military Support Foundation supplies military families with quality grocery and hygiene products, housewares, and even pet supplies via a food pantry it opened in August 2022.
During the holidays, the Military Support Foundation raises funds to provide each adopted family with a proper Thanksgiving and Christmas experience. Its mission is to provide complete holiday meals and fulfill every kid's Christmas wish list. For the soldiers, they each receive a personalized stocking decorated by hand and their own box of Christmas gifts.
"When we adopt you, we adopt you for life," said Reyness Price, founder of the Military Support Foundation. "We provide for these military families so their deployed loved ones don't have to worry about how their family is going to make ends meet while they are away. And when they return, we continue to meet their needs so they can focus on making up for lost time."
"We are immensely grateful for our partnership with Key Nutrients. Our adopted servicemen are ecstatic when they receive Key Nutrients products in their care packages because it helps them maintain healthy electrolyte levels during grueling training drills and extreme weather conditions while also making poor-tasting water more palatable."
For Key Nutrients Founder and CEO, Joseph Ochoa, the Military Support Foundation's work hits close to home. "Reyness and her team are bona fide saints. What they are doing is making an astronomical difference in the lives of these servicemen and their families. As a veteran that served abroad, I know first-hand what an impact these care packages can have on morale and the relief it brings knowing someone is looking out for your loved ones back home while you serve your country and fight for their freedom. Our donations are the least we can do to help this wonderful organization continue doing the amazing work that they do."
To date, Key Nutrients has provided thousands of units of product to the Military Support Foundation to help stock its pantry for local military families and to include in care packages shipped abroad.
People interested in donating to The Military Support Foundation or sponsoring one of its families for the holidays, can visit www.militarysupport.net.

Full text: Company Outlines Path Towards Quantum-Centric Supercomputing with New Hardware, Software, and System Breakthroughs
NEW YORK, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today kicked off the IBM Quantum Summit 2022, announcing new breakthrough advancements in quantum hardware and software and outlining its pioneering vision for quantum-centric supercomputing. The annual IBM Quantum Summit showcases the company's broad quantum ecosystem of clients, partners and developers and their continued progress to bring useful quantum computing to the world.
"The new 433 qubit 'Osprey' processor brings us a step closer to the point where quantum computers will be used to tackle previously unsolvable problems," said Dr. Darío Gil, Senior Vice President, IBM and Director of Research. "We are continuously scaling up and advancing our quantum technology across hardware, software and classical integration to meet the biggest challenges of our time, in conjunction with our partners and clients worldwide. This work will prove foundational for the coming era of quantum-centric supercomputing."
At the Summit, the company unveiled the following new developments:
- 'IBM Osprey' - IBM's new 433-quantum bit (qubit) processor
IBM Osprey has the largest qubit count of any IBM quantum processor, more than tripling the 127 qubits on the IBM Eagle processor unveiled in 2021. This processor has the potential to run complex quantum computations well beyond the computational capability of any classical computer. For reference, the number of classical bits that would be necessary to represent a state on the IBM Osprey processor far exceeds the total number of atoms in the known universe. For more about how IBM continues to improve the scale, quality, and speed of its quantum systems, read Quantum-Centric Supercomputing: Bringing the Next Wave of Computing to Life. 
- New quantum software addresses error correction and mitigation
Addressing noise in quantum computers continues to be an important factor in adoption of this technology. To simplify this, IBM released a beta update to Qiskit Runtime, which now includes allowing a user to trade speed for reduced error count with a simple option in the API. By abstracting the complexities of these features into the software layer, it will make it easier for users to incorporate quantum computing into their workflows and speed up the development of quantum applications. For more details read Introducing new Qiskit Runtime capabilities — and how our clients are integrating them into their use cases. 
- IBM Quantum System Two update – IBM's next-generation quantum system
As IBM Quantum systems scale up towards the stated goal of 4,000+ qubits by 2025 and beyond, they will go beyond the current capabilities of existing physical electronics. IBM updated the details of the new IBM Quantum System Two, a system designed to be modular and flexible, combining multiple processors into a single system with communication links. This system is targeted to be online by the end of 2023 and will be a building block of quantum-centric supercomputing — the next wave in quantum computing which scales by employing a modular architecture and quantum communication to increase its computational capacity, and which employs hybrid cloud middleware to seamlessly integrate quantum and classical workflows. 

 
- New IBM Quantum Safe technology: As quantum computers grow more powerful, it is crucial that technology providers take steps to protect their systems and data against a potential future quantum computer capable of decrypting today's security standards. From offering the z16 system with quantum safe technology, to contributing algorithms in connection with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) goal for standardization by 2024, IBM offers technology and services with these security capabilities. At the Summit, IBM and Vodafone announced a collaboration to explore how to apply IBM's quantum-safe cryptography across Vodafone's technology infrastructure. 
- Client & Ecosystem Expansion : Growth of IBM Quantum Network: IBM also announced today that German conglomerate Bosch has joined the IBM Quantum Network to explore a variety of quantum use cases. Other recent additions to the network include multinational telco Vodafone to explore quantum computing and quantum-safe cryptography, French bank Crédit Mutuel Alliance Fédérale to explore use cases in financial services, and Swiss innovation campus uptownBasel to boost skill development and promote leading innovation projects on quantum and high-performance computing technology. These organizations are joining more than 200 organizations — and more than 450,000 users — with access to the world's largest fleet of more than 20 quantum computers accessible over the cloud.

"The IBM Quantum Summit 2022 marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of the global quantum computing sector, as we advance along our quantum roadmap. As we continue to increase the scale of quantum systems and make them simpler to use, we will continue to see adoption and growth of the quantum industry," said Jay Gambetta, IBM Fellow and VP of IBM Quantum. "Our breakthroughs define the next wave in quantum, which we call quantum-centric supercomputing, where modularity, communication, and middleware will contribute to enhanced scaling computation capacity, and integration of quantum and classical workflows."

Full text: Vodafone partners with IBM to prepare for the quantum era of applications in telecommunications
NEW YORK, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced today at the IBM Quantum Summit 2022 that Vodafone Group is collaborating with IBM on quantum-safe cybersecurity, and also joining the IBM Quantum Network, which will give the company cloud access to IBM's advanced quantum computing systems, as well as IBM's industry-leading quantum expertise. The multinational telecommunications company will work with IBM to help validate and progress potential quantum use cases in telecommunications.
As part of this collaboration, Vodafone will explore quantum computing for a variety of telco use cases. The company will also advance their employees' skills in quantum technology through iterative prototyping led by IBM, as well as actively recruit quantum computing experts, to build a dedicated capability within its ranks. 
Throughout this engagement, Vodafone will explore how to apply IBM Quantum Safe cryptography technology across its entire and diverse network infrastructure and systems.  Future quantum computers will pose a threat to today's standard security, such as public key encryption. Quantum-safe cryptography protocols not only exist today, and offer the capability to help protect classical data and systems from these future quantum computers' potential decryption capabilities, but the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently announced that four algorithms — three of which IBM helped develop have been chosen to be part of a protocol for standardization by 2024. Vodafone's exploration of these protocols marks an IBM Quantum Safe first in understanding and preparing for this risk in telecommunications.
"Partnering with IBM provides us with access to quantum technology which has the potential to provide incredible network optimization. It's the sort of innovation that existing computers will never achieve alone, allowing us to save energy, reduce costs and give customer great connectivity in more places," said Luke Ibbetson, head of group R&D at Vodafone Group. "Investing in quantum-safe cryptography, now, also gives us the peace of mind that our infrastructure and customer data will also always be secure as we explore the benefits of quantum computing."
"Vodafone, as a leading mover in telco, is setting the example for their industry by exploring quantum computing applications for their business operations, as well as applying quantum-safe cryptography protocols to protect their long-term data and systems," said Scott Crowder, Vice President, IBM Quantum Adoption and Business Development. "We're excited to partner with Vodafone to help them simultaneously adopt quantum technology, and move to quantum-safe technology as they serve an entire ecosystem of operators, vendors, regulators, and open-source community."
IBM and Vodafone are also among initial members of the recently announced GSMA Post-Quantum Telco Network Taskforce, whose mission is to help define policy, regulation and operator business processes for the enhanced protection of telecommunications in a future of advanced quantum computing.
Vodafone joins more than 200 members of the IBM Quantum Network, a global community of Fortune 500 companies, start-ups, academic institutions, and research labs working to advance quantum computing and explore practical applications. Their engagement is designed to set them on a path to tap into this future of quantum advantage capabilities: when a computational task of business or scientific relevance can be performed more efficiently, cost-effectively, or accurately using a quantum computer than with classical computations alone.

TOKYO, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- 
- Despite some unfavorable factors such as a decrease in automobile production and unit sales due to the impact of the semiconductor supply shortage, and an increase in the cost of raw materials, consolidated operating profit for the fiscal first half (6 months) ended September 30, 2022, amounted to 453.4 billion yen (a year-on-year increase by 11.2 billion yen). This was due primarily to pricing that reflects increased product value, a reduction of incentives, an increase in motorcycle unit sales and favorable currency effects.
- Consolidated profit for the fiscal first half (6 months) attributable to owners of the parent amounted to 338.5 billion yen (a year-on-year decrease by 50.6 billion yen), due primarily to a decrease in the share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method.
- Despite the impact of a decrease in automobile unit sales and the forecasted continuation of upward pressure on costs, the previously announced forecast for consolidated operating profit for the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 (FY23) was revised upward by 40 billion yen to 870 billion yen reflecting an increase in motorcycle unit sales in some countries such as India and Vietnam and recent currency effects.
- The previously announced forecast for profit for the fiscal year attributable to owners of the parent was revised upward by 15 billion yen to 725 billion yen.

I.  Consolidated financial summary and business-by-business results for the fiscal first half (6 months) ended September 30, 2022

Full text: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Mesothelioma Victims Center is now recommending the lawyers at The Gori Law Firm to be the experts to call for a plumber, pipefitter or waterworks worker who has just been diagnosed with mesothelioma anywhere in the USA. When it comes to a plumber, pipefitter or waterworks worker with mesothelioma trying to find a local law firm to assist may not always be a great idea.
Mesothelioma compensation for a plumber, pipefitter or waterworks worker with this rare cancer might be in the millions of dollars as the lawyers at The Gori Law Firm are always happy to discuss at 866 532-2106. https://GoriLaw.Com
The group says, "The reason we have endorsed The Gori Law Firm for a plumber, pipefitter, waterworks worker or any type of skilled trades worker with mesothelioma anywhere in in the USA is because they are so knowledgeable about how a person like this might have been exposed to asbestos on the job. It is this type of wisdom that frequently translates into much better financial compensation results for their clients. 
"In order to simplify the process a lawyer from The Gori Law Firm can be in the home of a person with mesothelioma to visit with the person and their family within 24 hours of their initial call to explain the mesothelioma compensation process, to explain what they will do to achieve the best compensation results, and to learn more about how the person was exposed to asbestos.
"The in-home visit on the part of The Gori Law Firm lawyers is no obligation. For more information a person with mesothelioma or their family members are welcome to call The Gori Law firm anytime at 866 532-2106. We are certain you will be glad you did." https://GoriLaw.Com 
According to the CDC the states indicated with the highest incidence of mesothelioma include Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota, Louisiana, Washington, and Oregon.
However, based on the calls the Mesothelioma Victims Center receives a person with recently diagnosed mesothelioma could live in any state including New York, Florida, California, Texas, Illinois, Ohio, Iowa, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, Idaho, or Alaska. https://MesotheliomaVictimsCenter.Com
High-risk work groups for exposure to asbestos include US Navy Veterans, power plant workers, shipyard workers, oil refinery workers, steel mill workers, manufacturing/factory workers, pulp or paper mill workers, plumbers, electricians, auto mechanics, machinists, miners, construction workers, insulators, railroad worker, roofers, or firemen. As a rule, these types of workers were exposed to asbestos in the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's, or 1980's. US Navy Veterans make up about one-third of all US Citizens who are diagnosed with mesothelioma each year. https://GoriLaw.Com

NEW YORK, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Rhino, the leading real estate technology company, innovator in streamlining the rental experience, and pioneer of security deposit insurance, announced today agreements with a robust panel of industry-leading insurance carriers and reinsurers, including Ally Insurance, ReAlign, and Clear Blue Insurance Group with the support and guidance of Guy Carpenter's brokerage and advisory services.
"Despite a challenging environment across the insurance industry, Rhino's growth continues to be as robust as ever and we're seeing tremendous support from our partners across the insurance and housing industries due to the stability and resiliency of our product offerings," said Benjamin Lantos, Co-founder and Chief Risk Officer of Rhino. "Macroeconomic factors are driving renters toward innovative, common-sense solutions, like security deposit insurance. With the backing of our reinsurance partners and brokers, Rhino is poised for continued expansion beyond our partner network of more than six million homes, which will lead to further savings for renters in 2023 and beyond."
Rhino reached several key milestones earlier this year that demonstrated continued growth and accelerated adoption of its products and services, announcing that its security deposit insurance is offered in a partner network of over six million homes and saved American renters more than $1 billion in upfront move-in costs since 2017 . These accomplishments demonstrate the degree to which Rhino is transforming and streamlining the rental experience for both renters and multifamily property owners and operators.
"We're excited about the opportunity for continued growth in our partnership with Rhino and the ability to showcase new innovations in Clear Blue's platform," said Jerome Breslin, Chief Executive Officer of Clear Blue Insurance Group. "Our reinsurance partners are very supportive of the program in large part due to Rhino's track record of risk management and strong underwriting policies."
About Rhino
Rhino was founded to give renters everywhere greater financial freedom to plan and enjoy their lives. We eliminate the need for traditional security deposits by replacing them with smart, affordable insurance so renters can maintain control of their cash. Instead of a large upfront cash security deposit, renters pay Rhino a small fee, and Rhino insures the property owner for damages that might occur and lost rent. In addition, Rhino offers a Renters Insurance product, allowing property managers to offer competitive rates for renters across multi-region portfolios while giving renters the convenience of managing their policies in one self-serve platform and the ability to provide proof of insurance seamlessly. As of 2022, we are offered in over two million homes with a six million home partner network, and we have saved renters over $1 billion in cash.

Full text: 77% of brands are missing their greatest opportunity to meet subscription service revenue targets: AI and ML
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Intellimize, the first and only programmatic conversion rate optimization platform (CRO), today released a co-branded eTail study, 'How Brands Can Succeed In The Subscription Economy.'
As many as 75% of direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands are predicted to have a subscription based offering by 2023 1 . The study found that scaling personalization for every visitor, using AI and machine learning, will provide these brands the greatest opportunity to stand out and efficiently achieve their revenue targets.
The study indicated that subscription services are growing in popularity as consumers seek simplified ways to streamline their shopping and repurchasing process. As DTC brands seek better ways to support their customer's subscription needs and remain competitive in the highly saturated marketplace, more than three-quarters are missing a critical piece to enable them to scale the exceptional customer experiences that will be required.
"Subscription models provide higher customer lifetime value (LTV), but all too often, as marketers we put these programs on auto-pilot. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, like Intellimize, deliver a competitive advantage to brands which enables them to personalize customer engagement and overall experience, resulting in a higher lifetime value, " said Tracy Sestili, VP of Marketing at Intellimize.
Despite 90% of respondents having existing website conversion rate optimization (CRO) programs and 70% of respondents reporting success through personalization, only 23% of them are using AI or ML to help scale their CRO and personalization efforts for every visitor.
The study's respondents stated AI will likely deliver "essential competitiveness" for brands in the future, as well as "a higher engagement rate and better subscription turnover". Other respondents believe AI will be central for supporting "gamification models" as well as more "sophisticated" customer experiences.
Several of the respondents agree that AI offers the most promising future for their subscription sites, especially in terms of personalization. As one marketing department head from a toys and hobbies brand put it, "Artificial Intelligence-supported customer engagement features will provide wider opportunities for new customer acquisitions, journey analysis, and customized experiences every time."

Full text: New CLR® Brilliant Bath Lavender combines cleaning efficacy with the sensory reinforcement of lavender to align with consumer desire for products that provide an aromatic cleaning experience
CHICAGO, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- CLR® (pronounced "clear") brand of home cleaning products, manufactured by Jelmar, LLC, today announced the introduction of a new lavender scent for its CLR® Brilliant Bath product. The product delivers the same effective formula as the original Fresh Scent, but now in lavender.
"Universally, efficacy ranks top of the charts in how we choose our cleaning products. But the feeling and experience of what clean means differs from one person to the next, especially when it comes to fragrance," said Alison Gutterman, CEO and President of Jelmar. "Our CLR Brilliant Bath Fresh Scent was designed to meet the needs of those who prefer less of a fragrant experience. But, for some, the idea of clean has a scent to it. We have chosen to expand the range and introduce Lavender to provide a fresh alternative to our loyal users, but also to broaden the appeal to new customers who are discerning about both the product effectiveness and scent choices they make for their home." 
Those who prefer scented cleaning products know that fragrance is experiential. The new CLR Brilliant Bath in Lavender evokes a sense of calm with its cleaning power. The scent provides a silent, lingering confirmation around the home that the cleaning task has been completed.
CLR Brilliant Bath is a multipurpose, multi-surface bathroom cleaner with a powerful foam spray formulated to easily cut through dirt, calcium, lime, hard water deposits and soap scum. With the EPA Safer Choice certification, the formula features ingredients recognized as safer alternatives to traditional chemicals. It can be used on most bathroom surfaces, including shower doors, sinks, bathtubs, tiles, toilet bowls, and more.
The Brilliant Bath Lavender scent is among recent new product launches for the CLR brand within the last two years as the company continues to respond to consumer needs and expand its portfolio of cleaning products in the multi-purpose and all-purpose cleaning space. Beyond the classic CLR® Calcium, Lime, & Rust Remover, CLR has products for many cleaning needs around the home, including CLR® Active Clear, CLR® Everyday Clean, CLR® Mold & Mildew Clear, CLR® Fresh & Clean Garbage Disposal and more.
The original CLR Brilliant Bath offered in Fresh Scent is also soon debuting a "New and Improved" formulation in the New Year to minimize even further the aromatic experience for consumers who prefer to clean with less of a fragrance.
CLR Brilliant Bath in the new Lavender scent and the original Fresh Scent are available now for purchase online and shipping nationwide. You can also visit CLRbrands.com to find the products in a retailer near you.
About Jelmar, LLC: Jelmar is a leading manufacturer of a broad range of household cleaning products, including CLR® (pronounced "clear") and Tarn-X® brands of cleaners. With their powerful and effective formulas, these products are dedicated to getting the job done in virtually every area of the home for a home environment that's clear of cleaning challenges inside and out, from the kitchen and bathroom to the outdoor patio and garage.

Liberty Global Transaction Solutions Briefing Shines Light on Key Global M&A Insurance Claim Trends

Full text: BOSTON, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Liberty Global Transaction Solutions (GTS), part of Liberty Mutual Insurance, published its third annual analysis of its M&A insurance claims, providing buyers, sellers and deal advisors an unparalleled understanding of global M&A insurance claims by industry, region and cause.
The Liberty GTS 2022 Claims Briefing gives detailed data about the types of M&A deals and the industries most likely to involve a claim, as well as highlighting other important trends gleaned from GTS claims data between January 1, 2019 and July 31, 2022.
Headline takeaways include:
- The frequency of claims being reported is down slightly, with risks bound in 2019 currently running at 16% compared to a historical average of around 21%, and the widely anticipated post-COVID claims surge did not materialize.

- Mega-deals over $1B have the lowest claims notification frequency rate in both Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), as well as in the Americas. 

- By contrast, deals with an EV (estimated value) of $250m or less accounted for 64% of paid and reserved claims by value.

- Instances of multiple notifications have more than doubled since 2019, rising from 10% to 24.5%. The trend is most pronounced in the EMEA region, primarily due to an increased awareness amongst our insureds around their notification obligations.

Liberty GTS President Rowan Bamford commented: "Our annual claims briefing always gives an interesting insight into developments in the global M&A sector.  There was some uncertainty as to the impact the COVID-19 pandemic would have, but the expected surge in claims post-pandemic has not occurred. This underscores the strength of M&A deal makers in effectively judging the risk of individual M&As during the 18 months when COVID-19 caused major disruptions to due diligence and pricing.
Causes of claims
The briefing examined the most common causes for claims and found some interesting trends:
- Tax-related matters continue to account for a large number of notifications: 36% in the Asia/Pacific region, 34% in EMEA and 17% in the Americas. While most of these are precautionary in nature and are received within 24 months of the policy incepting, there has been an increase in the number of notifications involving large ($10M plus) tax-related issues.

- Accounting and financial issues make up 29% of high-severity and 32% of medium-severity claims despite only making up only 11% of total notifications over the last 18 months.

- 48% of non-tax-related notifications involved a third-party claim. The majority of these involve either employee or intellectual property related disputes.

- Economic headwinds – such as inflation, potential recession and supply chain disruption -  are likely to lead to heightened risks around certain issues such as undisclosed price increases, fraud, and accounts receivables.

Bamford commented "This year tax-related issues continued to be responsible for a large number of notifications, but on the non-tax side we are seeing a significant increase in third-party claims. This is quite likely to be due to the increased litigation threat faced by corporations as businesses explore all means of generating revenue when facing economic headwinds.
"Going forward, sellers will need to take into account ESG-related issues as buyers now expect them to give specific warranties on these issues. All parties in a transaction also face challenges from global economics.  Our underwriters remain ready to help clients navigate transactions through these turbulent times."

Full text: Kinetech and Mendix are excited to announce our sponsorship and participation at the Government Technology IT Leadership Forum in Austin, Texas on November 14, 2022. The event will be held at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Austin at 6505 N Interstate Hwy 35, Austin, TX 78752.
AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 9, 2022  /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Kinetech and Mendix are excited to announce our participation at the Government Technology IT Leadership Forum in Austin, Texas on November 14, 2022. The event will be held at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Austin at 6505 N Interstate Hwy 35, Austin, TX 78752.
Kinetech will be co-sponsoring the event with Mendix, the global leader in low-code.
The Texas IT Leadership Forum is the premier event for senior level technology executives and rising leaders. The purpose of the event is to foster discussion and dialogue on what it means to be a successful IT executive in the public sector. Additional conversation will be around the appropriate tools and strategies to assist current and emerging leaders. This event is an opportunity for government and industry to collaborate and address the most important policy, management, and leadership issues surrounding the future of digital government.
Together, Kinetech and Mendix will be conversing with Information Technology (IT) executives from around Texas about the potential of low-code. Governments around the world have leveraged low-code and no code solutions to rapidly modernize legacy systems, develop new services, and extend the life of systems of record.
Why Low-code is Significant for Government:
With over 50% of website traffic coming from mobile devices, governments everywhere are struggling to adapt to a mobile-first / cloud-first reality. From internal business applications to consumer facing / self-service solutions (B2C portals), organizations are struggling to enable the type and volume of digital services demanded by their stakeholders (employees, customers, citizens, etc).
The pandemic exacerbated these challenges, but low-code offers an antidote: the ability to design, develop, and deploy applications at scale. In effect, low-code platforms can help organizations do more with less.
Kinetech / Mendix - DIR Contract DIR-CPO-4735:
Through Kinetech's contract (DIR-CPO-4735) with the Texas Department of Information Resources (DIR), Mendix's industry leading low-code technology is now readily available for organizations in Texas. The Kinetech contract may be used by state and local government, public education, other public entities in Texas, as well as public entities outside the state. For more information please visit the DIR Cooperative Contracts page. Resellers are not available for this contract.
DIR-CPO-4735 covers Low-code / No Code, the Mendix Platform, Developer Tools, What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) Editor, Project & Portfolio Management, Workflow Automation, Robotic Process Automation, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML).
Kinetech is uniquely positioned to enable organizations to adopt low-code. The company was recently named as the first and only low-code certified expert firm in the United States by Siemens. This is due to the fact that Kinetech has the highest concentration of Mendix certified advanced and expert software architects in the United States. Together, Kinetech & Mendix provide citizen-centric software for digital government services.
Customers include: the City of Dallas, Dallas County, the City of San Antonio, the State of Michigan (Michigan.gov) and more. Additional information about the Texas IT Leadership forum may be found here.
About Kinetech:

Kinetech provides low-code enablement services and custom enterprise software, delivered through the cloud with a focus on improved business productivity.

Kinetech designs, builds, and supports mission-critical applications, client/vendor portals, and modernizes legacy systems.

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Agent IQ, a provider of digital customer engagement solutions specializing in making financial services more personal again, announced today that it has successfully raised $10 million in Series A funding. The round was led by Mendon Venture Partners and included participation from renowned VCs Acronym VC and Sierra Ventures and innovative banks including FNBO and others.
"Agent IQ's value proposition is among the most relevant opportunities right now for banks to partner and participate in leveraging innovative technologies in both an offensive and defensive manner," said John Clausen, Founding Partner, Mendon Venture Partners. "The company is at the forefront of relationship banking, helping banks engage customers in ways that they have come to demand. We are thrilled to have led this round, as well as to have joined the board." 
For years, community banks and credit unions have distinguished themselves from larger competitors and fintechs based on the quality and depth of their customer and member relationships. As market adoption of digital banking has accelerated, however, so too has a relationship disconnect between many consumers and their financial institutions. Funding investors recognize this market opportunity and Agent IQ's ability to address it.
Since 2018, Agent IQ has focused its attention on the retail and commercial banking market with a commitment to helping financial institutions ensure that digital banking remains highly personal for customers. Through its cost effective, AI augmented, scalable Lynq™ digital engagement platform (featuring messaging capabilities with the ability to translate real-time to more than 100 languages, video chat and AI-powered real-time insights), Agent IQ enables banks and credit unions to establish and grow happier, more loyal, more profitable relationships with customers and members.
"As the banking industry embraces the concept of digital transformation, too often it has been forced to sacrifice the fostering of deep, meaningful customer relationships in the name of on-demand convenience and digital capability," said Slaven Bilac, CEO & Co-Founder, Agent IQ. "Agent IQ exists to change this narrative. We are grateful for the trust that our investors have in our organization, and we will leverage this capital to lead community banking toward an environment where consumers derive the same level of personal benefit through the digital channel as they traditionally did through the branch, while also enabling banks and CUs to differentiate themselves with personal, seamless and efficient service."
About Agent IQ
Agent IQ develops digital platforms that empower clients to deepen their customer relationships, improve customer satisfaction and boost service efficiencies, leading to an increase in profitability while reducing the cost of serving. Agent IQ believes that augmenting the human banker is a better approach than replacing the human banker. Pragmatic application of cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning offers the promise of unprecedented scale, while keeping the focus on human empathy, creativity and personality.

About Mendon Venture Partners

Chemomab Presents Clinical Data from Investigator-Initiated Study Showing CM-101 Reduced Inflammatory and Fibrogenesis-Related Biomarkers in Patients with Severe Lung Injury Derived from Covid-19

Full text: ─New Findings Demonstrate CM-101's Anti-Inflammatory and Anti-Fibrotic Effects Are Highly Relevant to Inflammatory Lung Diseases ─
TEL AVIV, Israel, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Chemomab Therapeutics, Ltd. (Nasdaq: CMMB) (Chemomab), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of innovative therapeutics for fibrotic and inflammatory diseases with high unmet need, announced that clinical data presented today showed that CM-101 was safe and well-tolerated and achieved reductions in biomarkers associated with lung inflammation and fibrogenesis in a clinical study in patients hospitalized with COVID-19-derived lung injury. CM-101 is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody that neutralizes CCL24, a soluble protein with pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory effects. It is in development for the treatment of fibro-inflammatory disorders, including primary sclerosingcholangitis (PSC) and systemic sclerosis (SSc).
The presentation, Treatment with CM-101 Reduced Inflammatory & Fibrotic Biomarkers in Patients with COVID-19-Derived Lung Damage , was discussed by Chemomab co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Adi Mor at the Union World Conference on Lung Health 2022. 
Some of the mechanisms underlying lung inflammation resulting from COVID-19 infection are similar to those seen in chronic diseases involving lung inflammation and fibrosis, and this study was initiated by a physician/researcher who treats patients with systemic sclerosis and other rheumatological diseases. The objective of the study was to evaluate the drug's safety and activity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia, including its impact on biomarkers related to lung inflammation that are also relevant in systemic sclerosis.
The open label, single arm trial enrolled 16 adult COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory involvement.  All patients were hospitalized and were receiving standard of care therapy. All were treated with a single 10mg/kg intravenous dose of CM-101 on the first day of the study and followed for 30 days. Clinical parameters were tested daily during hospitalization and serum biomarkers were tested at baseline and on days 1, 3, 7 and 30 following drug administration.
Administration of CM-101 to this acutely ill patient population was found to be safe and well tolerated. CM-101 exposures and target engagement profiles were similar to what Chemomab researchers have seen in previous clinical studies of CM-101. Importantly, rapid reductions in serum biomarkers of lung inflammation, fibrogenesis and neutrophil activity were observed post-treatment with CM-101, consistent with the effects seen in previous preclinical and early clinical data.
Reductions in the serum levels of biomarkers seen in the study included the cytokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, two biomarkers that are highly associated with lung inflammation and are known to be strongly correlated with respiratory severity. For example, CXCL10 was reduced by a median change of 65% from baseline as soon as 24-hours post treatment with CM-101 and further reduced by almost 80% at day 3. The effect was sustained through the end of the follow-up period.
It was noteworthy too that patients receiving CM-101 demonstrated a rapid and robust median reduction of 50% in c-reactive protein, or CRP, a well-known general marker of inflammation, as soon as 48 hours post-administration.  CRP levels were further decreased by more than 90% at day 6 after CM-101 administration and remained stable until the end of the follow-up period. CM-101 also demonstrated larger and more rapid CRP reductions compared to a retrospective Covid-19 control group who had similar clinical characteristics and also received standard of care therapy.
Lastly, treatment with CM-101 impacted biomarkers that are associated with the formation and degradation of the extracellular matrix, such as Procollagen 4 and C3M, which were highly elevated in these patients at baseline and were significantly reduced by a median change of 25% as soon as 72 hours post-treatment, a reduction that remained stable until the end of the follow-up period.
"This study confirms and extends the safety and tolerability profile of CM-101 and demonstrates clinically relevant changes in biomarkers associated with lung inflammation and fibrogenesis," said Dr. Mor. "Moreover, we believe that these results add to the data suggesting that CM-101 has the potential to attenuate lung inflammation and fibrosis, further strengthening the rationale for treating systemic sclerosis patients with this drug. These new clinical data also contribute to a growing body of evidence demonstrating CM-101's anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects in varied organs including the lung, liver and skin."

About Chemomab Therapeutics Ltd. Chemomab is a clinical stage biotechnology company focusing on the discovery and development of innovative therapeutics for fibrotic and inflammatory diseases with high unmet need. Based on the unique and pivotal role of the soluble protein CCL24 in promoting fibrosis and inflammation, Chemomab developed CM-101, a monoclonal antibody designed to bind and block CCL24 activity. CM-101 has demonstrated the potential to treat multiple severe and life-threatening fibrotic and inflammatory diseases. It is currently in Phase 2 trials for primary sclerosing cholangitis and liver fibrosis, with a Phase 2 trial in systemic sclerosis expected to open around year-end, with first patients enrolled in early 2023.

Research team presenting on value of telerehabilitation and advances in patient-reported outcomes measurement for patients with dizziness and balance impairments
PITTSBURGH, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Highlighting the company's industry leadership, Net Health Research and Clinical Outcomes was selected to give three presentations at the 99 th American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) Conference, November 8 – 11 in Chicago.  ACRM is billed as the world's largest interdisciplinary rehabilitation research conference, bringing in top scientists and clinicians globally. 
Net Health's FOTO® Patient Outcomes is a leading innovator in rehabilitation therapy patient outcomes and analytics, providing front-line clinicians with accurate patient benchmarking against their professional peers nationwide using both modern measurement science (e.g., FOTO®, PROMIS) and traditional measures (e.g., Oswestry, DASH). Since its founding in 1992, FOTO has been involved in 139 research studies published in peer-reviewed medical or rehabilitation journals.
The ACRM presentations are: 
- Presentation: Associations Between Telerehabilitation and Outcomes for Patients with Low Back Pain During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Wednesday, November 9 - 3:55 PM – 4:11 PM
- Presentation: Reliability, Validity and Efficiency of an Item Response Theory-based Balance Confidence Patient Reported Outcome Measure. Thursday, November 10 - 3:55 PM – 4:11 PM
- Poster Presentation: New Item Response Theory-based Dizziness Impact Measures Were Reliable, Valid, and Efficient. Wednesday, November 9 – 12:23 – 12:28 PM

The presentations will be led by Daniel Deutscher, P.T., Ph.D., Senior Research Scientist for Net Health. The company's Poster Presentation was selected as the winner of this year's ACRM's Measurement Interdisciplinary Special Interest Group (ISIG) 'Advancing the Science of Measurement' Poster Award.
"We are excited and honored to have these three studies featured at ACRM," said Deanna Hayes, P.T., D.P.T., M.S., Director of Research and Clinical Outcomes for Net Health. "These presentations prove the rigor behind FOTO's measurement precision and commitment to reducing patient and provider burden while harnessing modern science and technology."
The studies provide valuable information for the rehabilitation industry and therapists today.
The Telerehabilitation (TR) Study showed a positive association between TR and rehabilitation outcomes, including better functional status outcomes and fewer visits, when all care was delivered through TR. The key takeaway from this observational study was that for people with low back pain, physical therapy delivered through TR was equally effective and more efficient than in-person care.  Additionally, it showed that TR effectiveness was optimal when used for all visits during the episode of care.
Two outcome measure development studies supported the reliability (accuracy), validity, and administration efficiency (low survey completion burden) for assessing balance confidence and functional status related to dizziness. Both studies combined included more than 48,000 adult patients with either balance impairments, vertigo, brain injury, or neck impairments. 
The dizziness research identified three valid domains (e.g., the positional, functional and/or emotional aspects that may influence vertigo) that need to be assessed separately, resulting in one of FOTO's most sophisticated measurement algorithms.  The findings will help therapists identify the domain most impactful to the patients' functional abilities, enabling them to better tailor treatments while increasing patient safety during rehabilitation.

Preclinical data demonstrates KR-335's ability to cause tumor regression, improved overall survival and complete responses across different murine tumor models as a monotherapy
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Kernal Biologics, Inc. (Kernal Bio) — a development-stage mRNA-technology company developing cancer therapeutics designed to improve patients' survival rate and quality of life — today announced it will have three presentations at the International mRNA Health Conference being held in Boston and virtually from November 8 th to 10 th , 2022.   
"We are delighted to present our work at this year's International mRNA Health Conference. Poor T cell infiltration and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments continue to be major obstacles in cancer immunotherapy," said Kernal Bio Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Yusuf Erkul, M.D. "In a preclinical study of KR-335, our tumor-selective mRNA LNP, we demonstrate tumor regression, improved overall survival and complete responses across different murine tumor models as a monotherapy."
"When expanding into therapeutic modalities, like cancer, universal translation of mRNA may become harmful. In another presentation, we demonstrate how it's possible to develop mRNA 2.0 - novel mRNA therapies using engineered mRNA molecules to translate in specific tissues and cell types. Using our proprietary computational and synthetic biology pipeline, we can rapidly develop and prototype sequences that have the potential to shift activity away from healthy cell types into malignant cells, thereby engineering mRNA to be onco-selective."
"In a third presentation," Erkul continued, "we describe a strategy to deliver mRNA to B cells specifically - reducing liver exposure while increasing drug delivery to extrahepatic tissues such as blood, spleen, and bone marrow. This may help to establish mRNA as a therapeutic modality in B cell-associated diseases."
Oral presentation title:  Onco-selective mRNA LNPs achieve tumor regression and improve overall survival in immune checkpoint resistant tumors 
Presenter: Yusuf Erkul, M.D., Co-founder & CEO
Date and time: November 9 th , 2022, from 4:45 pm – 5:30 pm
Oral or poster number: Poster #40
Oral presentation title: High throughput screening of RNA sequence elements to engineer onco-selective therapeutic mRNAs
Presenter: Tom Addison, Senior Assoc. Scientist, Synthetic Biology
Date and time: November 9 th , 2022, from 4:45 pm – 5:30 pm
Oral or poster number: Poster #92
Poster presentation title: Highly efficient mRNA delivery and protein expression in B cells using targeted lipid nanoparticles
Presenter: Jieni Xu, Ph.D., Senior Scientist, LNP Formulation
Date and time: November 9 th , 2022, from 5:30 pm – 7:00 pm
Poster number: Poster #100

Full text: - £16 million Series A led by Omega Funds, to advance disease-modifying oral medicines for debilitating chronic neurodegenerative disorders through IND-enabling studies
- Developing a pipeline of potential first-in-class brain-penetrant small molecule inhibitors of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which act through a novel mechanism of action, as treatments for Parkinson's and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
- Professor Seth Masters who identified a novel pathological mechanism in ALS targeted by NRG's pipeline, joins management team as VP of Discovery Biology

STEVENAGE, England, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- NRG Therapeutics, Ltd., an innovative neuroscience company targeting mitochondrial dysfunction, today announced the closing of a £16 million Series A financing, led by Omega Funds and joined by additional new investor Brandon Capital and founding investor the Parkinson's Virtual Biotech. In connection with the financing, Omega Funds Managing Director Claudio Nessi and Partner Francesco Draetta, as well as Brandon Capital Partner Jonathan Tobin, have joined the company's Board of Directors.
NRG is applying breakthrough science in the field of mitochondrial biology to develop disease-modifying therapeutics to slow or halt the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and ALS (also known as motor neurone disease or MND). The Series A proceeds will be used to advance the company's potential first-in-class brain-penetrant small molecules through IND-enabling studies.
The company's pre-clinical pipeline includes small molecule assets which inhibit the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) through a novel mechanism of action. Mitochondria are the powerhouses or batteries of cells and therefore are essential for maintaining cell health. There is now a substantial body of evidence demonstrating mitochondrial failure or dysfunction is common across many degenerative diseases. Inhibition of the mPTP has been shown to protect neurons, reduce neuroinflammation, and extend survival in pre-clinical disease models.
In vitro studies have demonstrated NRG's investigational new drugs protect mitochondria and increase the viability of human cells, and therefore have the potential to halt or significantly slow the progression of disease in individuals with Parkinson's or ALS. If successful in clinical trials, NRG's therapeutics would be the first disease-modifying medicine to prevent or delay disease progression for people with Parkinson's, where current treatments only provide management of disease symptoms. 
NRG is targeting a novel pathological mechanism in ALS, through which the protein TDP-43 triggers neuroinflammation via activation of the innate immune sensor STING, that was identified by its collaborator Professor Seth Masters, at Australia's WEHI (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research). Following the financing, Professor Masters has joined the NRG management team as VP of Discovery Biology. His laboratory at WEHI in Melbourne, Australia, will also include a sponsored team as part of a research agreement between NRG and WEHI. In addition, NRG has also expanded its UK R&D and operational base with a recent move to the Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst (SBC).
Claudio Nessi, Managing Director, Omega Funds said , "With the ultimate impact to patients at the forefront of Omega's process, we are focused on investing in transformative innovation with the potential to address devastating diseases with high unmet need. While drug development in neurological diseases has been challenging historically, emerging insights into disease drivers has led to somewhat of a resurgence. This is all the more important given the increasing prevalence and life-limiting effects of these debilitating diseases, as well as their immense healthcare cost burden.
We are impressed by the potential of NRG's small molecules as orally-bioavailable and brain-penetrant treatments and look forward to working with the team to move the programs through IND-enabling studies. If successful, the company's mitochondrial therapeutics could transform the lives of patients suffering from Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases."
Jonathan Tobin, Partner, Brandon Capital said , "We are delighted to add NRG Therapeutics to our growing European portfolio. Brandon Capital was attracted to the company by its first-in-class mechanism that could make a major difference to patients with devastating neurodegenerative diseases, combined with the seasoned management team that Brandon has backed previously.
"Given Brandon Capital's heritage in Australia we have a unique advantage in bringing insights and opportunities to our portfolio companies through access to the world-class science in Australia and its favorable environment for clinical development. We are delighted to see the collaboration between NRG and WEHI, with Professor Seth Masters further strengthening the NRG team."
NRG Therapeutics' co-founder and CEO Dr Neil Miller said, "We are excited to welcome Omega Funds and Brandon Capital as new investors and thank the Parkinson's Virtual Biotech for its continued support. We look forward to working with them, and our expanding team and R&D partners to bring new medicines and hope to the growing number of people worldwide living with debilitating neurodegenerative disorders."
The Parkinson's Virtual Biotech is the international drug discovery and development programme founded in 2017 by Parkinson's UK, the largest European charitable funder of Parkinson's research. Since 2019, the Virtual Biotech has supported NRG's work as it looks to accelerate new treatments for Parkinson's in years and not decades.
Parkinson's affects ~10 million individuals worldwide and occurs as a result of the loss of specific dopamine-producing cells in the brain that control muscle movement. It is the fastest-growing neurological disorder in the world, presenting a major healthcare challenge for society. ALS is a rare fatal neurodegenerative disorder that typically leads to death within 3-5 years of diagnosis. The marketed disease-modifying treatments for ALS provide an extension in survival of approximately 3-6 months. Given this extension in life is modest and patients are hugely debilitated in the terminal phase disease, an improved disease-modifying medicine is desperately needed.
Mills and Reeve advised NRG Therapeutics in the transaction.

HONG KONG, Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- On 8 November 2022 , we received good news from the 5th China International Import Expo (CIIE): the 1st In Shanghai, For the World has announced the recipients of the IP SHANGHAI Global Communications Corporate Case Best Practice Award . The organizing committee awarded Fosun International the IP SHANGHAI Global Communications Corporate Case Best Practice Award, in recognition of Fosun International's outstanding practices in global public health, including anti-malaria and anti-epidemic efforts.
This is China's first large-scale global communications corporate case event themed on urban IP . The event was organized by IP SHANGHAI and the Global Communications Case Management Platform of Shanghai International Studies University and was supported by the Shanghai Daily Multinational Companies Club.
As an enterprise rooted in Shanghai, China, Fosun has always been devoting itself to public health with its innovative products and global resources. Over the years, it has participated in anti-malarial campaigns in China and around the world, and has organized a series of public welfare activities with its global member companies to raise awareness and importance of malaria prevention and control around the world.
Self-developed and Manufactured Artesuante for Injection to Build a Malaria-free World
According to World Health Organization (WHO), in 2020, there were an estimated 241 million cases of malaria worldwide and 627,000 malaria-related deaths in the world. Among which, 95% of the cases and 96% of malaria-related deaths occurred in Africa, with about 80% being children under the age of five.
In the 1970s, Chinese scientist Tu Youyou first developed a new technology to extract artemisinin from ether. Based on this technology, a series of new antimalarial drugs, including China No. X-01 artesunate, was developed, which innovatively advanced the fight against malaria.
On 21 December 2005, artesunate tablet innovated by Fosun Pharma became the first pharmaceutical product prequalified by WHO (WHO-PQ), representing a breakthrough for the Chinese pharmaceutical industry. In 2011, Artesun®, artesunate for injection, which was self-developed and manufactured by Fosun Pharma, was recommended by the WHO as a first-line treatment of severe malaria. By the end of 2021, it has been used to treat over 48 million severe malaria patients worldwide.
Fosun has been working unremittingly to support the global fight against malaria. In April 2021, Fosun Foundation responded actively to the "Zero Malaria Starts with Me" campaign initiated by the WHO and the "Roll Back Malaria Partnership". Slogans, "Zero Malaria Starts with Me" and "Together We Build a Malaria-free World", were displayed on the advertising screens of Fosun's landmark buildings, including the Bund Finance Center in Shanghai, 28 Liberty in New York, EN Hotel Kyoto and EN Hotel Hiroshima in Japan, Atlantis Sanya, the Bund Fosun Center in Wuhan.
The English Premier League Wolverhampton Wanderers FC players made a video to call on everyone to take malaria prevention and control measures seriously and emphasize that malaria prevention and control is as important as taking good precautionary measures against COVID-19. Fosun Foundation and Fosun Pharma organized the "Draw a Malaria-free World" drawing competition at the Beacon International School in Ghana to educate children about malaria prevention and environmental protection. Fosun carried out a series of public welfare activities to call on the public to work together to fight against malaria.
Using Chinese Antimalarial Drugs in Africa to Help More People
In order to achieve the ultimate goal of building a malaria-free world, Fosuner, Cyrus Baidoo, has gone to the front line in Africa, where malaria is the most serious, and helped and cured many malaria patients with Chinese antimalarial drugs.
Cyrus Baidoo is the Marketing Manager of Fosun Pharma Sub-Saharan Africa. He visits many local hospitals every day to promote Chinese antimalarial drugs to doctors and patients. Many years ago, Cyrus worked in a world-renowned pharmaceutical company before joining Fosun. "A lot of my friends did not understand why I left an American company for a Chinese company. They said the company is too new and barely has any products," recalls Cyrus.
From being unfamiliar with and distrusting Chinese companies to now, where Fosun Pharma has become a global leader in malaria drugs and one of the most influential Chinese pharmaceutical brands in Africa, Cyrus witnessed the rapid development of Fosun Pharma in the field of antimalarial drugs. As of January 2022, Guilin Pharma, a subsidiary of Fosun Pharma, has a total of 30 antimalarial products prequalified by WHO (WHO-PQ), including 26 finished dosage forms and four APIs, making Fosun Pharma the leading antimalarial drug manufacturer with the most certifications.
In August 2018, Fosun Pharma's SPAQ-CO® Disp (co-packed sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine dispersible tablets and amodiaquine dispersible tablets), which indicated for the prevention of malaria in children, was pre-qualified by WHO (WHO-PQ). By the end of 2021, around 175 million children in high malaria transmission African countries had benefited from the "Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention Program", for which SPAQ-CO® Disp is used as the core drug to effectively reduce the morbidity of malaria in children under five years old in Africa.
Guo Guangchang, Chairman of Fosun International, said, "As a partner in the fight against malaria for China and the world, Fosun consistently commits to providing more cutting-edge solutions such as innovative medicinal products and global resources for malaria management and control. We will join forces and resources, and work together with malaria scientists as well as healthcare professionals to continue to carry out malaria education projects for the public, so as to leverage people's awareness of malaria prevention. We will actively participate in public health improvement and make steady efforts to build a malaria-free world."
In Shanghai, For the World. Thirty years after its establishment, Fosun will continue to uphold the original aspiration of "Self-improvement, Teamwork, Performance, and Contribution to Society", devote itself to global public health and public welfare undertakings, and provide innovative products and services to create happier lives for families worldwide.

TWTR FINAL DEADLINE: ROSEN, SKILLED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Twitter, Inc. Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important November 14 Deadline in Securities Class Action Filed by the Firm - TWTR

http://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/wire-feeds/twtr-final-deadline-rosen-skilled-investor/docview/2733669082/se-2?accountid=7082

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 8, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --
WHY:  Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Twitter, Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) between August 3, 2020 and August 23, 2022, both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"), of the important November 14, 2022 lead plaintiff deadline in the securities class action commenced by the Firm.
SO WHAT:  If you purchased Twitter securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.
WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Twitter class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=8303 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than November 14, 2022 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business operations and prospects. Specifically, that: (1) Twitter knew about security concerns on their platform; (2) Twitter actively worked to hide the security concerns from the board, the investing public, and regulators; (3) contrary to representations in SEC filings, Twitter did not take steps to improve security; (4) Twitter's active refusal to address security issues increased the risk of loss of public goodwill; and (5) as a result, defendants' statements about Twitter's business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
To join the Twitter class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=8303 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.
No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Full text: To schedule an interview or for further information, please contact: CMA Media Relations: MediaInquiries@cma.ca, Elena Gabrysz, 514-839-7296, Eric Lewis, 506-566-1671
VANCOUVER, BC, Nov. 8, 2022 /CNW/ - The Canadian Medical Association (CMA) is disappointed that the first in-person meeting of Canada's health ministers in four years has ended without arriving at immediate, meaningful solutions to address the concurrent, ongoing crises across our 13 Provincial and Territorial health systems.
We are encouraged that the federal government is prepared to increase health care investments through the Canada Health Transfer, something we have advocated for years. We support the call for the creation of a robust, national health data system. Sharing data and solutions is critical for quality improvement and essential to address ongoing stresses on health systems like COVID-19. We cannot address the collapse happening in disparate parts of our 13 health care systems without detailed, timely, data-driven understanding of existing challenges. We are also encouraged by the steps taken by some provinces and territories exploring regional licensure and team-based care.
Despite health ministers leaving Vancouver this week without an agreement between the federal and provincial/territorial governments regarding funding and without the announcement of a commitment to collaborate on solutions to address critical issues plaguing our health systems, the CMA and other health stakeholders will continue to advocate for actions that will stabilize health systems and ease the painful challenges that providers and patients are struggling with. Unless we work through funding discussions toward common priorities and actionable solutions, burned out health care workers, delayed health services and overwhelmed emergency departments will continue to be a reality for providers and patients across Canada.
Funding continues to be the dominant topic between governments. While increased funding is certainly needed, it cannot remain the sole focus. The CMA will continue to urge governments to collaborate across jurisdictional silos to get to the root of our health care system challenges. We can only transform health systems if we rebuild the foundations they are built upon.
The deterioration of our 13 provincial and territorial health systems continues. Health care providers are burning out at an accelerated rate. Patients continue to suffer with delayed access to the care they need.
We can overcome our shared crises with collaborative solutions. We have already presented a prescription for what needs to be done. We look to governments to act and renew our hope that change is coming.
