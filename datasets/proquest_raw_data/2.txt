Ramping Up Drive-Thru Sales Requires Meticulous Planning, Advises QSR Expert

Full text: HFA Architects and Engineers' Steven Baker cites need to carefully consider utilities, parking ratios, lease restrictions and other variables when executing drive-thru-focused QSR or fast-casual remodel projects 
BENTONVILLE, Ark., Dec. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Step-by-step planning and close collaboration can greatly speed up restaurant remodels focused on boosting drive-thru sales, advises HFA Architects and Engineers ' Steven Baker (AIA, NCARB) in an advisory piece for decision-makers in the fast-casual and quick-serve sectors.
In " Reinventing QSRs—one square foot at a time ," the architect and co-leader of HFA's Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) team notes that chains across the country continue to reconfigure buildings and sites for faster and easier pickup of online orders.
But "adapting QSRs can be a big undertaking," writes Baker, who works with one of the country's fastest-growing QSR chains. "In our experience, these projects run most efficiently when all parties collaborate and communicate from the outset and when key questions are asked and addressed in the right order."
In today's QSR sector, Baker notes, up to 75 percent of sales occur at drive-thrus, a trend fueled in part by the rapid growth of online-ordering apps from the likes of McDonald's, Starbucks, Domino's, Chick-fil-A and Taco Bell.
Meanwhile, fast-casual operators such as Panera, Chipotle Mexican Grill and Sweetgreen are honing their approaches to drive-thru lanes and pickup spaces. "Panera and Popeyes are even testing speech-recognition software—an AI called 'Tori'—to take customers' drive-thru orders," Baker writes.
But to capitalize on the demand, restaurant owners need to rethink how their sites and stores function. "For existing locations, the biggest trend is toward demolishing part or all of the dining room," Baker writes. "This frees up the square footage needed to increase back-of-house/kitchen capacity and/or support more drive-thru service."
Some QSR chains are even moving ahead with prototypes that eliminate dining areas entirely.
One example from the c-store sector is HFA's recent collaboration in Morrisville, Pa. on a drive-through-only store for Wawa. "The much-smaller buildings required for drive-thru-intensive prototypes can be built faster and at lower cost," Baker notes. "This is no small consideration given today's steep increases in construction costs and delays."
In addition, HFA's QSR group has consulted with several restaurant clients on higher-capacity equipment that allows these companies to meet growing demand without needing additional square footage.
Digital kiosks are also becoming more commonplace, allowing more and more customers to use their phones to input their orders and table numbers straight from the dining room—no counter-ordering required.
On restaurant remodels, HFA's role includes inquiring into technical factors and constraints, such as whether the client's proposed changes would require additional plumbing, electrical or grease-interceptor capacity. HFA engineers also communicate with municipal officials and inspectors throughout the permitting process.
Municipal parking ratios tend to be an important variable.
"When restaurants ramp up drive-thru capacity, they need to avoid demising too many parking spaces, which could violate those municipally-established parking minimums," Baker says. "Our QSR team has years of experience in helping restaurants' legal and real estate experts sort through such questions."
In addition, it is important to understand how the protective lease clauses of fellow shopping center tenants could limit options for the remodel. "For example, if the plan is to remove all windows from that restaurant and convert it into a drive-thru-only location, the landlord and/or co-tenants may need to give their approvals," he explains.
Potential obstacles related to utilities, parking ratios, lease restrictions and more should be addressed early—not after beautiful renderings and detailed plans have already been produced for municipal review, he notes.
"At HFA, we're excited to be a part of the QSR world's successful adaptation," Baker concludes. "We also see broad potential to apply lessons from these projects to our grocery, retail and c-store clients as they pursue their own creative strategies in the face of rapid change."

Full text: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The US Navy Veterans Mesothelioma Advocate is appealing to the family of a Veteran who has just been diagnosed with mesothelioma anywhere in the USA to call The Gori Law Firm anytime at 866-532-2106 to discuss what might be serious financial compensation-especially if the Veteran was a machinist, mechanic, plumber, electrician, construction worker, welder, boiler tender, or insulator. Financial compensation for a person like this might be in the millions of dollars. https://GoriLaw.Com
The Advocate says, "The US Armed Forces for the last 80 years have had some of the world's largest and most advanced skilled trades schools. The types of skilled trades Veterans would have been on the front lines of asbestos exposure in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and or early 1980s. Frequently after their time in the military a person like this went to work in the private sector-where they may have had additional exposure to asbestos."
"If the person we have just described sounds like your husband or dad, and he has confirmed mesothelioma anywhere in the USA please make his financial compensation a top priority and call The Gori Law Firm at 866-532-2106 to get the compensation process explained. For a Veteran client with mesothelioma the lawyers at the Gori Law Firm will also fill out the VA benefits paperwork-in the hopes of getting their client-client's wife additional compensation-at no charge."
"Every year more families trust The Gori Law Firm when dealing with a loved one's asbestos cancer diagnosis than any other firm in the nation. For more information a Veteran with mesothelioma and or their family are urged to call The Gori Law Firm anytime at 866-532-2106." https://GoriLaw.Com
The US Navy Veterans Mesothelioma Advocate wants a Veteran with mesothelioma or their family members to know that the size of a mesothelioma compensation settlement is based on how, where and when a person like this was exposed to asbestos. A Veteran's discharge papers called a DD214 might be extremely helpful and the asbestos exposure probably took place in the 1960s or 1970s. https://USNavyMesothelioma.Com
According to the CDC the states indicated with the highest incidence of mesothelioma include Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota, Louisiana, Washington, and Oregon.
However, based on the calls the US Navy Veterans Mesothelioma Advocate receives a US Navy Veteran who has been diagnosed with mesothelioma could live in any state including New York, Florida, California, Texas, Ohio, Iowa, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, Wyoming, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, Idaho, or Alaska. 
For more information about mesothelioma, please refer to the National Institutes of Health's web site related to this rare form of cancer: https://www.cancer.gov/types/mesothelioma

Venture Into Cures, a virtual benefit show, brought together world-renowned actors and musicians to raise awareness and funds for EB Research Partnership
NEW YORK, Dec. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - On November 20, EB Research Partnership (EBRP) presented the third annual Venture Into Cures, an inspiring virtual event featuring moving stories about individuals and families living with Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). Co-founders Eddie and Jill Vedder, along with their daughters Olivia and Harper Vedder, were joined by a lineup of celebrity friends and guests to raise over $1.3 million for EBRP, bringing the 3 year total raised via Venture Into Cures to more than $6 million, moving the organization closer to finding a cure for EB and leading the way for other rare diseases.
More than 75,000 people tuned in from over 70 countries to watch the special that included appearances and performances by Jonathan Brown, Dana Carvey, Billie Eilish, Will Ferrell, FINNEAS, Jack Harlow, Tom Holland, Joe Jonas, Kermit the Frog, John Legend, Macklemore, Lamorne Morris, Joy Oladokun, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Chris Pratt, Keanu Reeves, Olivia Rodrigo, Broken Social Scene, Molly Shannon, Hannah Simone, David Spade, Lauren Spencer-Smith, The Vedder Family, Emma Watson, Venus Willams, and more.
The one-hour virtual show was produced by EBRP and Door Knocker Media, with artist booking by one twenty eight. Watch the replay stream of Venture Into Cures at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DPxsVlofwA
"With our third annual Venture Into Cures event wrapped, we cannot begin to express our gratitude for those involved in this incredible show," said Jill Vedder, EBRP co-founder. "From the exceptional talent who offered their time and voice, through to the generous donors that continue to show up for the EB community, we are immensely grateful as we move closer to finding a cure for EB."
"Through the ongoing support of the Venture Into Cures' audience, donors and the patient and medical communities, we will continue to fund the most innovative and impactful global research. Over the last ten years, EBRP has made incredible strides in research and clinical trials. From the resiliency of the families and the commitment of scientists, together our ambitious goal is to cure EB in this decade," added Eddie Vedder, musician and EBRP co-founder .
Produced by EBRP and Door Knocker Media, with artist booking by one twenty eight, highlights from the show include:
Actor Emma Watson  introducing the story of fearless 6-year-old Elodie Kubik, the inspiration behind the annual fundraiser, Plunge for Elodie, in conversation with Kermit the Frog.
Singer/songwriter John Legend,  performing an exclusive presentation of his song, "Never Break", in honor of the brave young people and families living with EB.
An inspiring and educational conversation between Dr. Jean Y. Tang, and Dr. Anthony Oro, two brilliant scientists leading the charge to discover innovative EB therapies , introduced by athlete and entrepreneur, Venus Williams.
Actor Chris Pratt  introduces seven year old EB warrior Solomon Bonner, and shares his story through a mutual love of dinosaurs.
Singer and songwriter Olivia Rodrigo lends her voice to EBRP, through an inspiring video montage.
Actor Keanu Reeves  highlighted the story of Deana Molinaro, a young artist that uses the power of art to heal and inspire others with EB.
EB is a life-threatening genetic disorder that affects approximately 500,000 people worldwide. Called "Butterfly Children" because their skin is as fragile as a butterfly's wings, children with EB face severe pain, open external and internal wounds, and a grueling daily bandaging process. There is currently no treatment or cure for EB; however, EBRP's innovative Venture Philanthropy model is helping to fast-track not only a cure for EB but therapies that could affect thousands of other rare diseases.
Co-Founded by a dedicated group of parents, along with Jill and Eddie Vedder, as the largest global organization supporting EB research, EBRP has funded more than 120 projects through their innovative model, directly impacting the clinical landscape. Through EBRP's work, clinical trials for EB have increased by nearly 20 times, from 2 to nearly 40, including four Phase III clinical trials, the final phase before the FDA considers approval for a new therapy.

About EB Research Partnership Founded in 2010 by a dedicated group of parents and Jill and Eddie Vedder, EB Research Partnership (EBRP) is the largest global nonprofit dedicated to funding research aimed at treating and ultimately curing Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), a group of devastating and life-threatening skin disorders that affect children from birth.

Full text: PHOENIX, Dec. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Nikola Corporation (Nasdaq: NKLA), a global leader in zero-emissions transportation and energy supply and infrastructure solutions, today announced that the Department of Energy Loan Program Office (LPO) has invited its Phoenix Hydrogen Hub LLC project loan application into Part II of its application process. The project loan application was submitted on May 26, 2022 and has now progressed through the Part I review.
The application for a loan guarantee under the Innovative Clean Energy projects solicitation could amount to up to $1.3 billion for a renewable electrolytic hydrogen production facility that could produce up to 150 metric-tons of hydrogen per day. The application process is wholly dependent on the results of the Department of Energy (DOE) review and evaluation of a Part II Application, and DOE's determination whether to proceed.
The Phoenix Hydrogen Hub LLC owns 920 acres of undeveloped land in Maricopa County, Ariz.  where the facility is planned to be sited to support the deployment of Nikola's heavy duty, zero-emission fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and hydrogen refueling stations in California and the U.S. Southwest. The hub is expected to be built in phases to scale with the demand created from Nikola's zero-emission trucks, starting with 30 metric-tons, and expanding up to 150 metric-tons of hydrogen per day, with expansion potential as the demand for clean hydrogen in the region expands. Construction of the first phase is anticipated to be completed in 2024, once final investment decisions and customary regulatory approvals are finalized.
"This hub is intended to provide urgently needed renewable-based energy solutions and a pathway to a decarbonized transportation sector," said Nikola President, Energy, Carey Mendes. "What's more, it is expected to support clean hydrogen use in additional applications such as industrial, residential, and commercial heating, as well as for decarbonizing natural gas and power generation."

Full text: Funding will support La Plaza Delaware's entrepreneur development program
GEORGETOWN, Del. , Dec. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- M&T Bank is investing $100,000 in an initiative in Delaware that provides Latino entrepreneurs in Sussex County with the training and access to resources they need to grow their businesses and increase financial stability among their community.
The bank's grant to La Plaza Delaware will allow the nonprofit organization to hire additional staff and fund operations to serve more Latino entrepreneurs in 2023. Last year, M&T gave another $100,000 to help La Plaza hire a business/financial coach, support a 12-week, Spanish-language business development program for La Plaza's clients and start a loan pool administered by True Access Capital that makes loans of $2,500 to $10,000 to Latino-owned small businesses.
As part of M&T's latest donation to La Plaza, Nick Lambrow, the bank's regional president for Delaware, plans to meet with several Sussex County Latino business and community leaders to learn how M&T can help meet the needs of the county's rapidly growing Latino community. Approximately 10 percent of the county's residents identify as Hispanic or Latino – a nearly 60% increase from 2010 to 2021, according to U.S. Census data.
"M&T's commitment to La Plaza is one way we're supporting the Hispanic and Latino community in Sussex County, but it certainly won't be the only way," Lambrow said. "While we're focused on strengthening our existing relationships with organizations like La Plaza, we also want to increase our cultural fluency and spark additional growth and stability within this community. That's important to the overall success of Delaware."
M&T's branch in Georgetown, the seat of Sussex County, is among the bank's 118 designated as a multicultural banking center. Staff at the Georgetown branch volunteer to provide financial education to Latino entrepreneurs in La Plaza's "Launcher" business development program.
The bank's financial contribution to La Plaza also is part of M&T's $43 billion community growth plan announced in 2021 – a multi-year plan to make impactful investments in minority communities throughout the bank's 12-state footprint.
Since its launch in 2021, La Plaza Delaware has served more than 250 Latino-owned small businesses in Sussex County. The program includes a comprehensive package of business plan training, technical assistance, consultation services and access to credit to help Latino entrepreneurs start or expand their businesses. La Plaza also partnered with the Delaware Hispanic Commission and Nuestras Raices Delaware to create a leadership training program modeled after one developed by Chicago-based Hispanic Alliance of Career Enhancement.
"M&T Bank has supported us and our vision from the very beginning," La Plaza Delaware Executive Director Mary Dupont said. "We're very grateful and excited to see the many growth opportunities that these funds will provide our business owners and the communities where they live and work."

Full text: JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Dec. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (NYSE: FNF) ("FNF" or the "Company"), a leading provider of title insurance and transaction services to the real estate and mortgage industries and a leading provider of insurance solutions serving retail annuity and life customers and institutional clients through FNF's subsidiary, F&G Annuities & Life, Inc. ("F&G"), today announced completion of the distribution to FNF shareholders, on a pro rata basis, of approximately 15% of the common stock of its subsidiary, F&G. Effective today, F&G has commenced "regular-way" trading of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "FG". FNF retains control of F&G through an approximate 85% equity ownership stake and will continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol "FNF".
William P. Foley, II, Chairman of the Board of FNF, commented, "We are pleased to have successfully completed our planned dividend to FNF shareholders, on a pro rata basis, of approximately 15% of F&G's common stock, which we believe will highlight the substantial equity value of F&G that has been and will continue to be created. At the time of our acquisition of F&G in June of 2020, we committed to F&G doubling assets under management to $50 billion over five years through organic growth. In just over two years, Chris and his team are well ahead of expectations with F&G's assets under management increasing to $42 billion as of the third quarter of 2022. This financial performance not only validates our initial strategy during the acquisition, it also provides confidence for the future of F&G and its ability to generate value for both FNF and F&G shareholders."
Mike Nolan, Chief Executive Officer of FNF, said, "We want to congratulate the F&G team on their transition back to a public company. Importantly, we remain committed to F&G's business and talented team as F&G continues to grow through its multi-channel new business platform, while also benefitting from the rising interest rate environment. As F&G continues to scale, their steady and growing earnings over time will provide a counterbalance for our business during higher mortgage rate environments. In fact, F&G has contributed $900 million of adjusted net earnings over the last nine quarters on a cumulative basis. By retaining an approximate 85% majority interest in F&G, we will continue to benefit from F&G's growth and cash flow generation." 
Chris Blunt, President and Chief Executive Officer of F&G, added, "We are thrilled to achieve this milestone in partnership with FNF and appreciate their continued support. Since the time of our merger with FNF, we have successfully and profitably increased our market share as a result of greater exposure to new and existing products and distribution channels, growing assets under management to $42 billion. As a result, our business has reached an inflection point to balance our deployment of capital to fund growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through a quarterly cash dividend at an initial aggregate amount of approximately $100 million per year beginning in 2023. Looking forward, we are well-positioned for continued growth and I would like to thank our team for their extraordinary efforts."
BofA Securities, Inc. served as FNF's financial advisor and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP served as FNF's legal counsel in connection with the distribution transaction.

Carbon Credits Need More Supply and Integrity to Meet Global Demand, Says IEF

Full text: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Carbon credits could make a significant contribution to achieving net zero by 2050, but only if participants address issues over limited supply and integrity, the Secretary General of the International Energy Forum told a conference.
Trade in voluntary carbon credits could grow 100-fold by 2050 if teething problems are addressed, Joseph McMonigle said in a keynote address to the S&P Global Carbon Markets Conference in Barcelona.
"There is a huge opportunity for voluntary carbon markets, which can only be realized with concerted international efforts. Overall, the market is characterized by low liquidity, scarce financing, inadequate risk-management services, and limited data availability. Building trust in the market is vital to achieving these goals so we must work harder to improve transparency, standardization and stability," he told the audience in Barcelona.
A carbon credit is a permit which allows a country or organization to produce a certain amount of carbon emissions and which can be traded if the full allowance is not used. They come from four categories: avoided nature loss including deforestation; nature-based sequestration, such as reforestation; avoidance or reduction of emissions such as methane from landfills; and technology-based removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere like carbon capture, utilization and storage. According to the World Bank, global carbon credit revenue grew 60 percent to $84 billion in 2021.
The Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets estimates that demand for carbon credits could increase by a factor of 15 or more by 2030 and by a factor of up to 100 by 2050. Management consultant McKinsey issued a report in 2021 that estimates demand in 2030 in the range of 8 to 12 gigatons of CO 2  per year of carbon credits.
"It is critical that purchasing a carbon credit can be trusted to bring a real reduction in CO2 emissions," Mr McMonigle told the conference. "The market today lacks transparency and there is a lack of data on how money is spent. The world will need a voluntary carbon market that is large, transparent, verifiable, and environmentally robust."
In 2016, the European Commission found that 85 percent of projects it examined were unlikely to achieve their stated reduction claims. Similar conclusions were found in a 2019 ProPublica investigation and a 2021 study on forest preservation in California.
The second issue is supply of credits, Mr McMonigle said. "The development of projects would have to ramp up at an unprecedented rate," he said, adding that most of the potential supply of avoided nature loss and of nature-based sequestration is concentrated in a small number of countries.
Project and financing risks could reduce the supply of carbon credits to as little as 1 gigaton of CO 2  per year by 2030, according to the McKinsey report.
Policy makers need the carbon markets to work better because they are increasingly relying on them to deliver a portion of their promised reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris agreement, he told the conference. And companies are seeking higher volumes of carbon credits because their regulators and shareholders are demanding rapid and measurable progress towards net zero goals beyond what they can deliver internally.
Article 6 of the Paris Agreement is central to the development of an effective international market for trading carbon credits, Mr McMonigle said. "It serves as the crucial link between the trade in carbon credits and countries' commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, so it is vital that we see these talks come to a successful conclusion."
Talks at COP27 in Egypt were meant to deliver a breakthrough in implementing Article 6, but differences between the parties remain, and negotiations have been extended into 2023.
"Differences relate to the deadline for transferring emissions reduction projects listed under the Clean Development Mechanism to the new registry, the procedure for moving credits between countries, and the conditions for mandatory cancellations of credits," Mr McMonigle said.
Governments are also looking at how carbon credits can be used to promote clean energy technologies in the developing world, he added. The United States launched an initiative at COP27 to enable companies to earn credits for funding clean energy projects in the developing world. Launched by White House Climate Envoy John Kerry with the Bezos Earth Fund and Rockefeller Foundation, the Energy Transition Accelerator will create a new type of carbon credit for companies that deploy capital to retire unabated coal-fired power and accelerate the buildout of renewables in developing countries.
Governments in emerging markets, and in particular energy producers, have recently embraced carbon credits, Mr McMonigle said.
Saudi Arabia, for example, held its first auction in October, selling 1.4 million tons of high-quality, CORSIA-compliant and Verra-registered carbon credits. Elsewhere in the Middle East, Abu Dhabi Global Market and AirCarbon Exchange are setting up a voluntary carbon market based in the UAE capital, aiming for a launch in January.

Full text: New collaboration will develop assays that offer a streamlined workflow for analysing even the most challenging genes.
MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Asuragen, a Bio-Techne brand (NASDAQ: TECH) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies plc (Oxford Nanopore) (LSE: ONT), today announce a collaboration to develop assays designed to deliver more accurate and reliable options for reproductive health and carrier screening. Asuragen will leverage its gold-standard PCR technology with Oxford Nanopore's any-read-length DNA sequencing capabilities to develop the first sequencing system to identify the most challenging yet high prevalence carrier genes in a single, unified workstream that today requires multiple other methods.
Carrier screening identifies at-risk-couples (ARCs) with pathogenic variants associated with severe genetic disorders. This information can be used to determine the residual risk for passing on a condition to their children and help guide reproductive decision-making. Although traditional sequencing methods allow identification of large numbers of genetic sequence variants, they cannot effectively resolve many problematic genes, such as those with tandem repeats, copy number variation, pseudogenes, and structural variation, that are recommended in professional practice guidelines. For example, six of the 10 genes with the most common pathogenic variants in carriers are difficult to genotype using traditional methods, often requiring a complicated and costly combination of solutions.
The expectation to resolve these "hard-to-decipher" genes is also growing. In the latest recommendations from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), screening for more than 100 genes is recommended for all prospective parents, regardless of ancestry or ethnicity and more than a dozen of these genes are known to be significantly "dark" or "challenging" to genotype. Current characterisation of many of these genes requires a patchwork of cumbersome assays spanning different technologies and platforms that are both costly (time, labour, expertise) and provide incomplete data, covering only select pathogenic variants.
With this new collaboration, technical limitations can be addressed by combining two innovations: Asuragen's long-range PCR and Oxford Nanopore's any read-length sequencing capabilities. The integration of these technologies in a single workflow can resolve both challenging genes and conventional genes using a single sequencing system. This project will develop an integrated wet- and dry-bench kit for genotyping 11 genes that are critical for carrier screening, including eight notoriously hard to analyze genes, and will be configured modularly to accommodate multiple use cases for carrier screening. It is estimated that these 11 genes represent conditions covering ~70% of all pathogenic variants associated with a severe genetic disorder for ARCs compared to bespoke panels that require more than 15 times the number of genes along with multiple technologies to resolve them, including sequencing. 
"We are really pleased to be working with Asuragen to develop more robust, reliable and accessible options for reproductive health and carrier screening," said Gordon Sanghera, Chief Executive Officer of Oxford Nanopore Technologies. "Oxford Nanopore's ability to sequence any-length of DNA fragment will help to overcome the technical barriers with the current standard screening. This is especially important as we know that a significant fraction of all disease-causing variation is made up of variants that are larger than a single base-pair substitution, meaning that nanopore-based sequencing can quickly and accurately characterise variants of interest throughout the genome."
"Asuragen has a long history of delivering accurate, dependable and easy-to-run kitted assays that resolve complex structural variants, such as repeat expansions and copy number changes," commented Kim Kelderman, President of Bio-Techne's Genomics and Diagnostics segment. "As clinical labs face increased demand for more informative and equitable carrier screening tests, we look forward to being a trusted partner to help laboratories implement scalable assays for these and other variants by leveraging the best of AmplideX ® PCR and nanopore-based sequencing. Our work with Oxford Nanopore's technology and team has demonstrated tremendous promise for how innovations from both companies can be combined to create a complete solution for conventional and challenging genes alike." 
The Asuragen kit will include reagents and tools for target enrichment, analysis software, and use a workflow that integrates Oxford Nanopore's library preparation reagents and sequencing instruments. The assay will enable high-volume reference and specialty laboratories to provide more and better information for "hard-to-do" genes, consolidate traditional assays into a single workflow and reduce overall costs in a scalable system framework. This will also enable further decentralisation of reproductive health analysis by providing an easy-to-run, streamlined procedure for laboratories to perform carrier screening in house for those genes that most contribute to the carrier burden in diverse populations.

Full text: SALT LAKE CITY, Dec. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The food industry continues to face significant, simultaneous crises, including labor shortages, inflation, product shortages, supply chain disruptions, an ongoing war overseas, and climate change putting food production at risk. Now, industry expert Kari Hensien, RizePoint CEO, predicts what's ahead in 2023.
"As we continue to face serious threats to our food supply, food businesses should be mindful of key trends and predictions for 2023. In the coming year, we should be focusing on sustainable food production, prioritizing DEI, training differently, and relying on digital solutions that can help boost transparency, accuracy, safety, and quality. Luckily, tech solutions have become more affordable and accessible for food businesses of all sizes," Kari explained.
Kari's 10 key predictions for 2023 include:
- A focus on sustainable food production.  Climate change is putting food production at risk. Therefore, there will be a renewed effort around sustainable food production, like vertical farming, hydroponics, and aquaponics.
- Quality and accuracy are king.  To make your customers feel valued and appreciated, get their orders right! Implement solutions to boost accuracy, which will elevate a variety of critical metrics, including improved customer satisfaction and loyalty, increased revenue, positive reviews, word-of-mouth recommendations, etc.
- Digital solutions will become more affordable and widely used.  Digital efforts don't have to break the bank. Organize supplier certifications and streamline supplier collaboration in the process. Gain visibility and identify/predict the operational improvements that will maximize your business success.
- Continued efforts to overcome conflicts.  The food industry continues to face major, concurrent crises, including production delays, food shortages, and extreme weather impacting crops. Food businesses will have to work hard to keep the lights on and deliver products (and promises) to customers.
- A rise in workplace accountability.  Moving forward, organizations will need to prioritize broader social accountability. This includes a focus on hiring a diverse workforce to ensure your products and services are being delivered by people that represent your increasingly diverse customer base. Now more than ever, treating employees fairly and equitably is key to securing a knowledgeable, stable, and productive workforce.
- Training will change. Historically, food businesses trained employees by explaining how things should be done. But what if you thought about training differently? Train, practice, demonstrate, and reinforce to boost employee confidence and retention. Encourage employees to ask questions, seek feedback, and feel empowered. Create a collaborative culture vs. a punitive one.
- The supply chain will become more transparent.  It's critical to implement safety and quality protocols for your business, but it's not enough. You must also inspect safety, quality, and traceability all along the supply chain. Thanks to more affordable, accessible tech tools, this is now possible for brands of all sizes and budgets, and you can get started without a big investment. Focus on what the regulations require and use digital solutions to seamlessly manage your vendors' safety and QA certifications.
- Consumers will embrace the hybrid model.  Customers have become accustomed to the hybrid of in-person, pickup and delivery, so food businesses need to excel at all these models, focusing on safety and accuracy for each.
- Operational data and programs will gain credibility in the Board Room.  Business intelligence will connect operational data and improvement to business performance.
- Remote brand protection . A growing number of companies are looking for ways to protect their locations and/or facilities if they can't physically reach them for audits or inspections. Maybe it's a travel issue to that area or maybe it's cost prohibitive, but tech solutions can save quality teams as much as 70%, which is a huge win at a time when every dollar counts.

HOUSTON, Dec. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Sempra Infrastructure, a subsidiary of Sempra (NYSE: SRE) (BMV: SRE), today announced it has entered into a long-term sale and purchase agreement (SPA) with INEOS, for the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Phase 1 of its Port Arthur LNG project under development in Jefferson County, Texas.
Under the SPA, INEOS has agreed to purchase approximately 1.4 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of LNG delivered free-on-board from the proposed Phase 1 liquefaction project for a term of 20 years. Additionally, the companies have signed a non-binding heads of agreement (HOA) for INEOS' potential purchase of an additional 0.2 Mtpa from the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 project under development.
"We are excited to finalize our commercial relationship with INEOS as a valued long-term LNG off-taker from the Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 development project," said Justin Bird, CEO of Sempra Infrastructure. "We look forward to advancing this project so we can begin delivering new supplies of U.S. LNG to our European partners, as they pursue more secure energy for their customers."
"We are pleased to have reached this milestone together with Sempra Infrastructure that will facilitate further access to U.S. LNG supplies," said David Bucknall, CEO of INEOS Energy. "This agreement is a critical part of our new global LNG supply chain that will enable us to deliver cleaner and reliable energy to our businesses and customers."
The Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project is permitted and expected to include two natural gas liquefaction trains and LNG storage tanks and associated facilities capable of producing, under optimal conditions, up to approximately 13.5 Mtpa of LNG. A similarly sized Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 project is also competitively positioned and under active marketing and development.

Full text: Maria Pappas, (312) 603-6202
CHICAGO, Dec. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- As property tax bills land in Cook County mailboxes over the coming days, businesses and homeowners will likely find higher bills with some gentrifying Latino neighborhoods in Chicago seeing eye-popping increases of nearly 46%, according to a Treasurer's Office analysis of 1.8 million tax bills.
The analysis, which examined bills for the 2021 tax year, shows that property taxes across Cook County rose by $614 million — a 3.8% increase — for a total of $16.7 billion going to pay for schools, public safety, medical care, parks, libraries and other government services.
The increased tax burden is not shared equally. Homeowners will pay 53.6% of the rise, while businesses will pay 46.4%. Some Chicago communities — affluent areas along the north lakefront and pockets of working-class Latino neighborhoods — will see their taxes jump dramatically.
The increase in taxes in some gentrifying Latino neighborhoods likely will raise concerns that residents could be priced out of their homes. In the Lower West Side, a predominantly Latino community, the median homeowner's tax bill increased by $2,275 to $7,239, a 46% jump over 2020's property taxes. In Avondale, another predominantly Latino community, the median tax bill shot up 27%.
"There are still inequities in our property tax system and we need to straighten it out," said Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas.
Meanwhile, many struggling, predominantly Black neighborhoods saw significant reductions in their median taxes, such as West Garfield Park where homeowner taxes dropped nearly 45%.
Overall, the median tax bill for homeowners in Chicago went up nearly 8%. The Treasurer's analysis shows four factors drove those increases:
- A new Illinois property tax law allows many governments to "recapture," or recover, the total of any taxes refunded to property owners who appealed their taxes the previous year. This new recapture law added $131 million to tax bills across Cook County. Chicago Public Schools is getting $32.3 million, the largest recapture payment in Cook County.

- Property assessments, used to determine how much someone pays, rose across the city this year — fueling a $141 million increase into the city's special economic development funds, known as Tax Increment Finance districts. None of that $141 million may be used to cover government services, so it is effectively an additional property tax.

- City Hall increased the amount of money it needed for operations by $94 million, and Chicago Public Schools increased its tax levy by $114 million.

- The Assessor's Office last year reduced the values of homes anywhere from 8% to 12% because of the COVID-19 Pandemic. But homes' estimated market values have risen, and the Board of Review, the tax assessment appeal agency, dramatically lowering commercial assessments set by the Assessor, which caused more of the overall tax burden to fall on homeowners.

Pappas, who annually studies the impact of government property taxes, said the newly enacted recapture law "now will be an annual tax increase."
Elsewhere, taxes in the North and Northwest suburbs, increased by $94 million, with most homeowners and commercial property owners getting higher bills. Taxes grew to a smaller extent in the South and Southwest suburbs, where the increase was $35 million.

TORONTO, Dec. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - For the fourth quarter ended October 31, 2022, BMO Financial Group (TSX: BMO) (NYSE: BMO) recorded net income of $4,483 million or $6.51 per share on a reported basis, and net income of $2,136 million or $3.04 per share on an adjusted basis.
"This year, we continued to execute on our strategy to strengthen and grow each of our diversified businesses. Against the backdrop of a rapidly changing macroeconomic environment, we delivered on our commitments to positive operating leverage, improved efficiency and achieved above-target return on equity. Our strong performance was supported by targeted investments in technology and talent which delivered award winning customer and employee experiences. Very good revenue performance was driven by robust, high-quality growth in loans and deposits and expanding net interest margins, all underpinned by our leading risk management approach," said Darryl White, Chief Executive Officer, BMO Financial Group.
"Looking ahead to 2023, the economic environment remains uncertain, with inflation and higher interest rates expected to slow the economy in the near term. We have a proven track record of sustained performance and remain well positioned to deliver in any environment. We will continue to dynamically manage capital and resources to grow our businesses and support our customers while finalizing preparations for the natural next step in our North American growth strategy, the approval, closing and integration of Bank of the West.
"BMO has a long-standing, deep sense of purpose, and we are leveraging our position as a leading financial services provider to make progress for a thriving economy, sustainable future and an inclusive society, while targeting continued top-tier returns for our shareholders," concluded Mr. White.
Concurrent with the release of results, BMO announced a first quarter 2023 dividend of $1.43 per common share, an increase of $0.04 from the prior quarter, and an increase of $0.10 or 8% from the prior year. The quarterly dividend of $1.43 per common share is equivalent to an annual dividend of $5.72 per common share.

Significant Events
During the first quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of our EMEA Asset Management business to Ameriprise Financial, Inc., including the transfer of certain U.S. asset management clients, and on April 30, 2021, we completed the sale of our Private Banking business in Hong Kong and Singapore to J. Safra Sarasin Group. Collectively, we refer to these transactions as "divestitures". The divestitures reduced net revenue and expenses by approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, on both a reported and an adjusted basis, compared with the prior year.
On December 20, 2021, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement with BNP Paribas to acquire Bank of the West and its subsidiaries. Under the terms of the agreement, we will pay a cash purchase price of US$16.3 billion, or US$13.4 billion net of an estimated US$2.9 billion of excess capital (at closing) at Bank of the West. The transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the first calendar quarter of 2023, is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. We expect to fund the transaction primarily with excess capital, reflecting our strong capital position, including the added impact of the 20,843,750 common shares issued for $3,106 million on March 29, 2022, and anticipated capital generation.
On closing, the acquisition is expected to add approximately US$92 billion of assets, US$59 billion of loans and US$76 billion of deposits to our consolidated balance sheet. These amounts are based on the financial position and results of Bank of the West as at the period ended September 30, 2022.
This acquisition aligns with our strategic, financial and cultural objectives, and meaningfully accelerates our U.S. growth. Building on the strength of our performance and our integrated North American foundation, the acquisition will bring nearly 1.8 million customers to BMO and will further extend our banking presence through an additional 503 branches and commercial and wealth offices in key U.S. markets. After closing, our footprint will expand to 32 states, including an immediate scaled entry into the attractive California market, where we expect to deliver a highly competitive offering to new growth markets, combining the strength of our digital banking platform and our strong banking team to generate good customer growth.
A signature strength of Bank of the West is the deep relationships formed between its customers, its employees, and the communities they have served for over 100 years. As part of this transaction, we do not plan to close Bank of the West branches, and we are committed to retaining front-line Bank of the West branch employees.
Leveraging our deep integration experience and proven track record in U.S. expansion, we remain confident that we can achieve annual pre-tax cost synergies of approximately US$670 million (C$860 million) through operational efficiencies across our combined businesses. Integration planning is underway and is being overseen by a dedicated joint integration management office.
Under IFRS, the purchase price will be allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities of Bank of the West at closing, on the basis of their relative fair values, with the difference recorded as goodwill. The fair value/par value differences, referred to as the fair value mark, will be amortized to income over the estimated life of an underlying asset (liability). Intangible assets identified, including the core deposit intangible related to non-maturity deposits, will be amortized over their estimated life. The fair value of fixed rate loans, securities and deposits is largely dependent on interest rates. If interest rates increase, the fair value of the acquired fixed rate assets (in particular, loans and securities) will decrease, resulting in higher goodwill. If interest rates decrease, the opposite would be true. Conversely, the fair value of floating rate assets (liabilities) and non-maturity deposits approximate par, providing no natural fair value change offset. Changes in goodwill relative to our original assumptions announced on December 20, 2021 will impact capital ratios at closing, because goodwill is treated as a deduction from capital under the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) Basel III rules. In addition, given that the purchase price of the acquisition is in U.S. dollars, any change in foreign exchange translation between the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar between the announcement and the closing of the acquisition will result in a change to the Canadian dollar equivalent goodwill.
We are proactively managing exposure to capital from changes in fair value of the assets and liabilities of Bank of the West at closing. As part of our fair value management actions, we entered into interest rate swaps that increase in value as interest rates rise, resulting in mark-to-market gains recorded in trading revenue. These swaps were largely offset from an interest rate risk perspective through the purchase of a portfolio of matched-duration U.S. treasuries and other balance sheet instruments that generate net interest income. Together, these transactions aim to mitigate the effects of any changes in goodwill arising from changes in interest rates between the announcement and closing of the acquisition, with the associated revenue (loss) treated as an adjusting item. In addition, BMO entered into forward contracts, which qualify as accounting hedges, to mitigate the effects of changes in the Canadian dollar equivalent of the purchase price on closing. Changes in the fair value of these forward contracts are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) until closing of the transaction.
The impact of the fair value management actions on our results was treated as an adjusting item. The current quarter included $4,541 million pre-tax ($3,336 million after-tax) revenue related to the management of interest rate changes, comprising $4,698 million of mark-to-market gains on certain interest rate swaps as at October 31, 2022, recorded in non-interest revenue, as well as a loss of $157 million on a portfolio of primarily U.S. treasuries and other balance sheet instruments recorded in net interest income. Fiscal 2022 results included $7,713 million pre-tax ($5,667 million after-tax) revenue, comprising $7,665 million recorded in non-interest revenue and $48 million recorded in net interest income.
The impact on our Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio related to these fair value management actions was approximately 95 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2022, and the cumulative impact was approximately 150 basis points in fiscal 2022. In addition, the changes in the fair value of the forward contracts increased OCI by $706 million in the current quarter and increased OCI by $638 million in the current year.
This Significant Events section contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
Fourth Quarter 2022 Performance Review
The order in which the impact on net income is discussed in this section follows the order of revenue, expenses and provision for credit losses, regardless of their relative impact.
Adjusted results and ratios in this Fourth Quarter 2022 Performance Review section are on a non-GAAP basis and discussed in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.
Adjusted results in the current quarter excluded the impact of the announced acquisition of Bank of the West, comprising revenue of $3,336 million ($4,541 million pre-tax) related to the management of the impact of interest rate changes between the announcement and closing of the acquisition on its fair value and goodwill, as well as acquisition and integration costs of $143 million ($191 million pre-tax). In addition, current quarter adjusted results excluded the impact of a legal provision of $846 million ($1,142 million pre-tax) related to a lawsuit associated with a predecessor bank, M&I Marshall and Ilsley Bank, comprising interest expense of $515 million pre-tax and non-interest expense of $627 million pre-tax, including legal fees of $22 million. For further information, refer to Note 24 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements in BMO's 2022 Annual Report. Adjusted net income also excluded the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition and integration costs in both the current and the prior years.
Reported net income increased from the prior year, primarily due to the impact of the above noted fair value management actions, and adjusted net income decreased 4%, with higher net revenue offset by higher expenses and a higher provision for credit losses. Net income increased in U.S. P&C and decreased in BMO Capital Markets, BMO Wealth Management, and Canadian P&C. On a reported basis, Corporate Services recorded net income compared with a net loss in the prior year, and on an adjusted basis, Corporate Services results were relatively unchanged.
Canadian P&C
Reported and adjusted net income was $917 million, a decrease of $16 million or 2% from the prior year. Results were driven by an 11% increase in revenue, primarily due to higher net interest income reflecting strong balance growth and higher net interest margins, more than offset by higher expenses and a higher provision for credit losses compared with a recovery in the prior year.
U.S. P&C
Reported net income was $660 million, an increase of $151 million or 30% from the prior year, and adjusted net income was $662 million, an increase of $147 million or 29%. The impact of the stronger U.S. dollar increased revenue and net income growth by 9%, and expense growth by 8% on a reported basis.
On a U.S. dollar basis, reported net income was $488 million, an increase of $82 million or 21% from prior year, and adjusted net income was $489 million, an increase of $79 million or 19%. Reported and adjusted results were driven by an 18% increase in revenue, primarily due to higher net interest income reflecting higher net interest margins and loan balances, partially offset by higher expenses and a higher provision for credit losses compared with a recovery in the prior year.
BMO Wealth Management
Reported net income was $298 million, compared with $345 million in the prior year, and adjusted net income was $298 million, a decrease of $51 million or 14% from the prior year. Wealth and Asset Management  (1)  reported net income was $221 million, a decrease of $66 million or 24% from the prior year, primarily due to higher underlying expenses from continued investments in the business and divestitures. Insurance net income was $77 million, an increase of $19 million from the prior year, primarily due to benefits from changes in investments to improve asset liability management.
BMO Capital Markets
Reported net income was $357 million, a decrease of $174 million or 33% from the prior year, and adjusted net income was $363 million, a decrease of $173 million or 33% . Reported and adjusted results were impacted by current market conditions, resulting in lower Investment and Corporate Banking revenue, partially offset by higher Global Markets revenue, higher expenses, and a lower recovery of the provision for credit losses compared with the prior year.
Corporate Services
Reported net income was $2,251 million, compared with a reported net loss of $159 million in the prior year, and adjusted net loss was $104 million, compared with an adjusted net loss of $107 million. Reported results increased, primarily due to higher revenue reflecting the fair value management actions, partially offset by the legal provision noted above. Adjusted results were relatively unchanged from the prior year.
Capital
BMO's Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio was 16.7% as at October 31, 2022, an increase from 15.8% at the end of the third quarter of 2022, primarily driven by the benefit from fair value management actions related to the announced acquisition of Bank of the West, internal capital generation and common shares issued from treasury under the shareholder dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan, which were partially offset by the legal provision noted above and higher risk-weighted assets.
(1)
Wealth and Asset Management was previously known as Traditional Wealth.

Credit Quality
Total provision for credit losses was $226 million, compared with a recovery of the provision for credit losses of $126 million in the prior year. The provision for credit losses on impaired loans was $192 million, an increase of $108 million from the prior year. The provision for credit losses on impaired loans as a percentage of average net loans and acceptances ratio was 14 basis points, compared with 7 basis points in the prior year. There was a $34 million provision for credit losses on performing loans in the current quarter, compared with a $210 million recovery in the prior year. The $34 million provision for credit losses on performing loans in the current quarter reflected a deteriorating economic outlook and balance growth, largely offset by continued reduction in uncertainty as a result of the improving pandemic environment and portfolio credit improvement. The $210 million recovery of credit losses in the prior year largely reflected an improving economic outlook and portfolio credit improvement, partially offset by growth in loan balances.

Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Bank of Montreal's public communications often include written or oral forward-looking statements. Statements of this type are included in this document, and may be included in other filings with Canadian securities regulators or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or in other communications. All such statements are made pursuant to the "safe harbor" provisions of, and are intended to be forward-looking statements under, the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and any applicable Canadian securities legislation. Forward-looking statements in this document may include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to our objectives and priorities for fiscal 2023 and beyond, our strategies or future actions, our targets and commitments (including with respect to net zero emissions), expectations for our financial condition, capital position or share price, the regulatory environment in which we operate, the results of, or outlook for, our operations or for the Canadian, U.S. and international economies, the closing of our proposed acquisition of Bank of the West, including plans for the combined operations of BMO and Bank of the West and the financial, operational and capital impacts of the transaction, and include statements made by our management. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as "will", "would", "should", "believe", "expect", "anticipate", "project", "intend", "estimate", "plan", "goal", "commit", "target", "may", "might", "schedule", "forecast", "outlook", "timeline", "suggest", "seek" and "could" or negative or grammatical variations thereof.
By their nature, forward-looking statements require us to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific in nature. There is significant risk that predictions, forecasts, conclusions or projections will not prove to be accurate, that our assumptions may not be correct, and that actual results may differ materially from such predictions, forecasts, conclusions or projections. We caution readers of this document not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, as a number of factors – many of which are beyond our control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict – could cause actual future results, conditions, actions or events to differ materially from the targets, expectations, estimates or intentions expressed in the forward-looking statements.
The future outcomes that relate to forward-looking statements may be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to: general economic and market conditions in the countries in which we operate, including labour challenges; the severity, duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and possibly other outbreaks of disease or illness, and their impact on local, national or international economies, as well as their heightening of certain risks that may affect our future results; information, privacy and cybersecurity, including the threat of data breaches, hacking, identity theft and corporate espionage, as well as the possibility of denial of service resulting from efforts targeted at causing system failure and service disruption; benchmark interest rate reforms; technological changes and technology resiliency; political conditions, including changes relating to, or affecting, economic or trade matters; climate change and other environmental and social risk; the Canadian housing market and consumer leverage; inflationary pressures; global supply-chain disruptions; changes in monetary, fiscal, or economic policy; changes in laws, including tax legislation and interpretation, or in supervisory expectations or requirements, including capital, interest rate and liquidity requirements and guidance, and the effect of such changes on funding costs; weak, volatile or illiquid capital or credit markets; the level of competition in the geographic and business areas in which we operate; exposure to, and the resolution of, significant litigation or regulatory matters, our ability to successfully appeal adverse outcomes of such matters and the timing, determination and recovery of amounts related to such matters; the accuracy and completeness of the information we obtain with respect to our customers and counterparties; failure of third parties to comply with their obligations to us; our ability to execute our strategic plans, complete proposed acquisitions or dispositions and integrate acquisitions, including obtaining regulatory approvals; critical accounting estimates and judgments, and the effects of changes to accounting standards, rules and interpretations on these estimates; operational and infrastructure risks, including with respect to reliance on third parties; the possibility that our proposed acquisitions, including our acquisition of Bank of the West, do not close when expected, or at all, because required regulatory approvals and other conditions to closing are not received or satisfied on a timely basis, or at all, or are received subject to adverse conditions or requirements; the anticipated benefits from proposed acquisitions, including Bank of the West, such as potential synergies and operational efficiencies, are not realized; our ability to manage exposure to capital arising from changes in fair value of assets and liabilities between signing and closing; our ability to perform effective fair value management actions and unforeseen consequences arising from such actions; changes to our credit ratings; global capital markets activities; the possible effects on our business of war or terrorist activities; natural disasters and disruptions to public infrastructure, such as transportation, communications, power or water supply; and our ability to anticipate and effectively manage risks arising from all of the foregoing factors.
We caution that the foregoing list is not exhaustive of all possible factors. Other factors and risks could adversely affect our results. For more information, please refer to the discussion in the Risks That May Affect Future Results section, and the sections related to credit and counterparty, market, insurance, liquidity and funding, operational non-financial, legal and regulatory, strategic, environmental and social, and reputation risk, in the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section of BMO's 2022 Annual Report, all of which outline certain key factors and risks that may affect our future results. Investors and others should carefully consider these factors and risks, as well as other uncertainties and potential events, and the inherent uncertainty of forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by the organization or on its behalf, except as required by law. The forward-looking information contained in this document is presented for the purpose of assisting shareholders and analysts in understanding our financial position as at and for the periods ended on the dates presented, as well as our strategic priorities and objectives, and may not be appropriate for other purposes.
Material economic assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained in this document include those set out in the Economic Developments and Outlook section of BMO's 2022 Annual Report, as well as in the Allowance for Credit Losses section of BMO's 2022 Annual Report. Assumptions about the performance of the Canadian and U.S. economies, as well as overall market conditions and their combined effect on our business, are material factors we consider when determining our strategic priorities, objectives and expectations for our business. Assumptions about Bank of the West's balance sheet, product mix and margins, and interest rate sensitivity were material factors we considered in estimating the fair value and goodwill and intangibles amounts at closing, and assumptions about our integration plan, the efficiency and duration of integration and the alignment of organizational responsibilities were material factors we considered in estimating pre-tax cost synergies.
In determining our expectations for economic growth, we primarily consider historical economic data, past relationships between economic and financial variables, changes in government policies, and the risks to the domestic and global economy.

Adjusted results remove certain items from reported results and are used to calculate our adjusted measures as presented in the above table. Management assesses performance on a reported basis and an adjusted basis, and considers both to be useful. Revenue, net of CCPB, as well as reported ratios calculated net of CCPB and adjusted results, measures and ratios in this table are non-GAAP. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section, and for details on the composition of non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios, as well as supplementary financial measures, refer to the Glossary of Financial Terms.

(2)
We present revenue, efficiency ratio and operating leverage on a basis that is net of CCPB, which reduces the variability in insurance revenue from changes in fair value that are largely offset by changes in the fair value of policy benefit liabilities, the impact of which is reflected in CCPB. For further information, refer to the Insurance Claims, Commissions and Changes in Policy Benefits section.

LCR and NSFR are disclosed in accordance with the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions' (OSFI's) Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) Guideline, as applicable.

(4)
Capital ratios and risk-weighted assets are disclosed in accordance with OSFI's Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) Guideline, as applicable.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures
Results and measures in this document are presented on a GAAP basis. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts are in Canadian dollars and have been derived from our audited annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). References to GAAP mean IFRS. We use a number of financial measures to assess our performance, as well as the performance of our operating segments, including amounts, measures and ratios that are presented on a non‑GAAP basis, as described below. We believe that these non‑GAAP amounts, measures and ratios, read together with our GAAP results, provide readers with a better understanding of how management assesses results.
Non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios do not have standardized meanings under GAAP. They are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and should not be viewed in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP results.
For further information regarding the composition of non-GAAP and other financial measures, including supplementary financial measures, refer to the Glossary of Financial Terms.
Our non-GAAP measures broadly fall into the following categories:
Adjusted measures and ratios
Management considers both reported and adjusted results and measures to be useful in assessing underlying ongoing business performance. Adjusted results and measures remove certain specified items from revenue, non-interest expense and income taxes, as detailed in the following table. Adjusted results and measures presented in this document are non-GAAP. Presenting results on both a reported basis and an adjusted basis permits readers to assess the impact of certain items on results for the periods presented, and to better assess results excluding those items that may not be reflective of ongoing business performance. As such, the presentation may facilitate readers' analysis of trends. Except as otherwise noted, management's discussion of changes in reported results in this document applies equally to changes in the corresponding adjusted results.
Measures net of insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities (CCPB)
We also present reported and adjusted revenue on a basis that is net of insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities (CCPB), and our efficiency ratio and operating leverage are calculated on a similar basis, as reconciled in the Revenue section. Measures and ratios presented on a basis net of CCPB are non-GAAP. Insurance revenue can experience variability arising from fluctuations in the fair value of insurance assets, caused by movements in interest rates and equity markets. The investments that support policy benefit liabilities are predominantly fixed income assets recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in insurance revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income. These fair value changes are largely offset by changes in the fair value of policy benefit liabilities, the impact of which is reflected in CCPB. The presentation and discussion of revenue, efficiency ratios and operating leverage on a net basis reduces this variability, which allows for a better assessment of operating results. For more information refer to the Insurance Claims, Commissions and Changes in Policy Benefit Liabilities section.
Presenting results on a taxable equivalent basis (teb)
We analyze consolidated revenue on a reported basis. In addition, we analyze revenue on a taxable equivalent basis (teb) at the operating group level, consistent with our Canadian peer group. Revenue and the provision for income taxes in BMO Capital Markets and U.S. P&C are increased on tax-exempt securities to an equivalent pre-tax basis. These adjustments are offset in Corporate Services. Presenting results on a teb basis reflects how our operating groups manage their business and is useful facilitating comparisons of income between taxable and tax-exempt sources. The effective tax rate is also analyzed on a teb basis for consistency of approach, with the offset to operating segment adjustments recorded in Corporate Services.
Tangible common equity and return on tangible common equity
Tangible common equity is calculated as common shareholders' equity less goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets, net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on tangible common equity is commonly used in the North American banking industry and is meaningful because it measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether they were acquired or developed organically.

Foreign Exchange
The Canadian dollar equivalents of BMO's U.S. segment results that are denominated in U.S. dollars increased relative to the third quarter of 2022 and increased relative to the fourth quarter of 2021, due to changes in the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate. The table below indicates the relevant average Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rates and the impact of changes in those rates on BMO's U.S. segment results. References in this document to the impact of the U.S. dollar do not include U.S. dollar-denominated amounts recorded outside of BMO's U.S. segment.
Economically, our U.S. dollar income stream was not hedged against the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates during 2022 and 2021. Changes in exchange rates will affect future results measured in Canadian dollars, and the impact on those results is a function of the periods in which revenue, expenses, provisions for (recoveries of) credit losses and income taxes arise.
Refer to the Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section of BMO's 2022 Annual Report for a discussion of the impact that changes in foreign exchange rates can have on BMO's capital position.

Net Income
Q4 2022 vs. Q4 2021
Reported net income was $4,483 million, an increase of $2,324 million from the prior year, and adjusted net income was $2,136 million, a decrease of $90 million or 4% from the prior year. Adjusted results in the current quarter excluded the impact of the announced acquisition of Bank of the West, comprising revenue of $3,336 million ($4,541 million pre-tax) related to the management of the impact of interest rate changes between the announcement and closing on its fair value and goodwill. In addition, the current quarter adjusted results excluded the impact of a legal provision of $846 million ($1,142 million pre-tax) related to a lawsuit associated with a predecessor bank, M&I Marshall and Ilsley Bank, including legal fees of $22 million. Adjusted results in both periods excluded the impact of divestitures, the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles assets, and acquisition and integration costs. Reported EPS was $6.51, an increase of $3.28 from the prior year, and adjusted EPS was $3.04, a decrease of $0.29 from the prior year. The public share offering completed on March 29, 2022, reduced reported EPS by $0.18 and adjusted EPS by $0.07.
The increase in reported results reflected higher revenue from fair value management actions, partially offset by the legal provision noted above. Adjusted results decreased as higher net revenue was more than offset by a higher provision for credit losses compared with a recovery in the prior year, and higher expenses. Net income increased in U.S. P&C, driven by higher net interest income, and decreased in BMO Capital Markets reflecting the impact of lower levels of client activity given market conditions, in BMO Wealth Management, in part due to divestitures, and in Canadian P&C with higher revenue more than offset by higher provisions for credit losses and higher expenses. On a reported basis, Corporate Services recorded net income compared with a net loss in the prior year, due to the impact of fair value management actions and acquisition and integration costs, as well as the impact of the legal provision noted above, and was relatively unchanged on an adjusted basis.
Q4 2022 vs. Q3 2022
Reported net income was $4,483 million, an increase of $3,118 million from the prior quarter, and adjusted net income was $2,136 million, relatively unchanged from the prior quarter. Reported EPS increased $4.56 from the prior quarter, and adjusted EPS decreased $0.05, largely due to an increase in dividends on preferred shares and distributions payable on other equity instruments.
The increase in reported results reflected higher revenue related to fair value management actions, partially offset by the legal provision and higher acquisition and integration costs noted above. Adjusted results were relatively unchanged, as higher net revenue was offset by higher expenses and a higher provision for credit losses. Net income increased in BMO Capital Markets and U.S. P&C, and decreased in Canadian P&C and BMO Wealth Management. On a reported basis, Corporate Services recorded net income compared with a net loss in the prior quarter, and on an adjusted basis, Corporate Services recorded a net loss compared with net income in the prior quarter.
For further information on non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios in this Net Income section, refer to the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.
Revenue
Q4 2022 vs. Q4 2021
Reported revenue was $10,570 million, compared with $6,573 million in the prior year. Reported revenue, net of CCPB, was $10,939 million, an increase of $4,463 million from the prior year, and adjusted revenue, net of CCPB was $6,913 million, an increase of $437 million or 7%. Adjusted net revenue in the current quarter excluded revenue of $4,541 million from the impact of fair value management actions related to the announced acquisition of Bank of the West, as well as interest expense of $515 million related to a legal provision. The impact of the stronger U.S. dollar increased revenue growth by 4% and 3% on a reported and adjusted basis, respectively.
Revenue increased in our P&C businesses, primarily due to higher net interest income reflecting strong loan growth and higher net interest margins, partially offset by lower non-interest revenue. Revenue decreased in BMO Wealth Management, as higher net interest income and growth in net new client assets, were more than offset by divestitures and weaker global markets. Revenue decreased in BMO Capital Markets, as higher Global Markets revenue was more than offset by lower Investment and Corporate Banking revenue. On a reported basis, revenue in Corporate Services increased from the prior year, due to the adjusting items noted above, and decreased on an adjusted basis.
Reported net interest income was $3,767 million, relatively unchanged from the prior year, and adjusted net interest income was $4,439 million, an increase of $683 million or 18%. Adjusted results excluded interest expense of $515 million related to the legal provision and a loss of $157 million related to fair value management actions. Net interest income increased in the P&C businesses and BMO Wealth Management and decreased in BMO Capital Markets, due to strong balance growth and higher net interest margins reflecting the impact of the higher interest rate environment and lower trading-related net interest income, which decreased $188 million and was largely offset in trading non-interest revenue.
Average earning assets were $1,021.5 billion, an increase of $103.3 billion or 11%, primarily due to loan growth, higher securities balances and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower short-term cash balances.
BMO's overall reported net interest margin of 1.46% decreased 16 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to the impact of the adjusting items noted above and the impact of lower trading-related activities, partially offset by higher margins in the P&C businesses. Adjusted net interest margin excluding trading-related net interest income and earning assets of 1.86% increased 20 basis points, primarily due to higher net interest margins in our P&C businesses.
Reported non-interest revenue, net of CCPB, was $7,172 million, an increase of $4,452 million from the prior year, and adjusted non‑interest revenue, net of CCPB, was $2,474 million, a decrease of $246 million or 9% from the prior year, primarily due to lower net securities gains, other than trading, and lower underwriting and advisory revenue reflecting the impact of current market conditions, as well as the impact of divestitures, partially offset by higher trading revenue.
Gross insurance loss was $218 million, compared with revenue of $223 million in the prior year, primarily due to changes in the fair value of investments and lower annuity sales. Insurance revenue can experience variability arising from fluctuations in the fair value of insurance assets caused by movements in interest rates and equity markets. The investments that support policy benefit liabilities are predominantly fixed income and equity assets recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in insurance revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The impact of these fair value changes was largely offset by changes in policy benefit liabilities, which are discussed in the Insurance Claims, Commissions and Changes in Policy Benefit Liabilities section.
Q4 2022 vs. Q3 2022
Reported revenue was $10,570 million, compared with $6,099 million in the prior quarter, and reported revenue, net of CCPB, was $10,939 million, an increase of $5,253 million from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily driven by a gain on fair value management actions in the current quarter, compared with a loss in the prior quarter. Adjusted revenue, net of CCPB, increased $282 million or 4%. The impact of the stronger U.S. dollar increased revenue growth by 3% and 2% on a reported and adjusted basis, respectively.
Revenue increased in our P&C businesses due to higher net interest income, partially offset by lower non-interest revenue, and in BMO Capital Markets, with higher revenue in both Investment and Corporate Banking and Global Markets. Net revenue was relatively unchanged in BMO Wealth Management. On a reported basis, revenue in Corporate Services increased from the prior quarter due to the adjusting items noted above, and decreased on an adjusted basis.
Reported net interest income decreased $430 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to the impact of the adjusting items noted above, and adjusted net interest income increased $280 million or 7%, with increases across all operating groups. 
Average earning assets increased $48.7 billion or 5%, primarily due to loan growth, the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and the impact of higher low-yielding assets in BMO Capital Markets and Corporate Services.
BMO's overall reported net interest margin decreased 25 basis points, primarily due to the impact of the adjusting items noted above and the impact of higher low-yielding assets in BMO Capital Markets and Corporate Services, partially offset by a higher net interest margin in U.S. P&C. Adjusted net interest margin, excluding trading-related net interest income and earning assets, increased 3 basis points.
Reported non-interest revenue, net of CCPB, increased $5,683 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to higher trading revenue related to fair value management actions, and adjusted non-interest revenue, net of CCPB, was relatively unchanged from the prior quarter, with lower securities gains, other than trading largely offset by higher trading revenue.
Gross insurance revenue decreased $760 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to changes in the fair value of investments and lower annuity sales. The decrease in insurance revenue was largely offset by changes in CCPB, as discussed in the Insurance Claims, Commissions and Changes in Policy Benefit Liabilities section.
For further information on non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios, and results presented on a net revenue basis in this Revenue section, refer to the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.

Total Provision for Credit Losses
Q4 2022 vs. Q4 2021
Total provision for credit losses was $226 million, compared with a recovery of the provision for credit losses of $126 million in the prior year. The total provision for credit losses as a percentage of average net loans and acceptances ratio was 16 basis points, compared with a recovery of 11 basis points in the prior year. The provision for credit losses on impaired loans was $192 million, an increase of $108 million from the prior year. The provision for credit losses on impaired loans as a percentage of average net loans and acceptances ratio was 14 basis points, compared with 7 basis points in the prior year. There was a $34 million provision for credit losses on performing loans in the current quarter, compared with a $210 million recovery in the prior year. The $34 million provision for credit losses on performing loans in the current quarter reflected a deteriorating economic outlook and balance growth, largely offset by continued reduction in uncertainty as a result of the improving the pandemic environment and portfolio credit improvement. The $210 million recovery of credit losses in the prior year largely reflected an improving economic outlook and portfolio credit improvement, partially offset by growth in loan balances.
Q4 2022 vs. Q3 2022
Total provision for credit losses was $226 million, an increase of $90 million from the prior quarter. The total provision for credit losses as a percentage of average net loans and acceptances ratio was 16 basis points, compared with 10 basis points in prior quarter. The provision for credit losses on impaired loans increased $88 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to higher provisions in both of our P&C businesses and BMO Capital Markets. The provision for credit losses on impaired loans as a percentage of average net loans and acceptances ratio was 14 basis points, compared with 8 basis points in the prior quarter. There was a $34 million provision for credit losses on performing loans in the current quarter, compared with a $32 million provision in the prior quarter.

Insurance Claims, Commissions and Changes in Policy Benefit Liabilities
Insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities (CCPB) were negative $369 million, compared with $97 million in the prior year. Results decreased, largely due to changes in the fair value of policy benefit liabilities. CCPB decreased $782 million from the prior quarter, due to changes in the fair value of policy benefit liabilities and the impact of lower annuity sales. These changes were largely offset in insurance revenue.
Non-Interest Expense
Q4 2022 vs. Q4 2021
Reported non‑interest expense was $4,776 million, an increase of $973 million from the prior year, and adjusted non‑interest expense was $3,954 million, an increase of $234 million or 6%. Adjusted non-interest expense excluded the impact of the legal provision in the current quarter and the impact of divestitures, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and acquisition and integration costs in both periods. The increase in reported expenses reflected the impact of the legal provision, as well as higher acquisition and integration costs related to the announced acquisition of Bank of the West. Reported and adjusted expenses increased due to higher employee-related costs, including higher salaries, performance-based compensation and sales force expansion, and higher computer and equipment costs, partially offset by divestitures. The impact of the stronger U.S. dollar increased expenses by approximately 4% on a reported basis and 3% on an adjusted basis.
The reported gross efficiency ratio was 45.2%, compared with 57.9% in the prior year. On a net revenue basis  (1) , the reported efficiency ratio was 43.7%, compared with 58.7% in the prior year, and the adjusted efficiency ratio was 57.2%, compared with 57.4% in the prior year.
Reported gross operating leverage was positive 35.3%. On a net revenue basis, reported operating leverage was positive 43.3% and adjusted operating leverage was positive 0.4%.
Q4 2022 vs. Q3 2022
Reported non-interest expense increased $917 million or 24% from the prior quarter, and adjusted non-interest expense increased $193 million or 5%. The increase in reported expenses included the impact of the legal provision, as well as higher acquisition and integration costs related to the announced acquisition of Bank of the West in the current quarter. Reported and adjusted expenses increased, due to higher employee-related costs, higher computer and equipment costs, and higher professional fees. The impact of the stronger U.S. dollar increased expenses by approximately 3% on an reported basis and 2% on an adjusted basis.
The reported gross efficiency ratio was 45.2%, compared with 63.3% in the prior quarter. On a net revenue basis, the reported efficiency ratio was 43.7%, compared with 67.9% in the prior quarter, and the adjusted efficiency ratio was 57.2%, compared with 56.7%.

Provision for Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes was $1,454 million, an increase of $814 million from the fourth quarter of 2021, and an increase of $1,128 million from the third quarter of 2022. The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 24.5%, compared with 22.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 19.3% in the third quarter of 2022.
The adjusted provision for income taxes was $597 million, a decrease of $59 million from the fourth quarter of 2021, and a decrease of $5 million from the third quarter of 2022. The adjusted effective tax rate was 21.8% in the current quarter, compared with 22.7% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 22.0% in the third quarter of 2022. The change in the reported effective tax rate in the current quarter relative to the third quarter of 2022 and the fourth quarter of 2021 was primarily due to the impact of higher pre-tax income in the current quarter. The change in the adjusted effective tax rate in the current quarter relative to the fourth quarter of 2021 was primarily due to earnings mix, including the impact of lower pre-tax income in the current quarter.

Capital Management
BMO continues to manage its capital within the framework described in the Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section of BMO's 2022 Annual Report.
Fourth Quarter 2022 Regulatory Capital Review
BMO's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio was 16.7% as at October 31, 2022, an increase from 15.8% at the end of the third quarter of 2022, primarily driven by the benefit from fair value management actions related to the announced acquisition of Bank of the West, internal capital generation and common shares issued from treasury under the shareholder dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan (DRIP), which were partially offset by the impact of a legal provision related to a lawsuit associated with a predecessor bank, M&I Marshall and Ilsley Bank, and higher risk-weighted assets (RWA). Refer to the Significant Events section for further information on the fair value management actions.
CET1 Capital was $60.9 billion as at October 31, 2022, an increase from $55.5 billion as at July 31, 2022, primarily from the benefit of the fair value management actions, the impact of foreign exchange movements, internal capital generation and common shares issued under the DRIP, partially offset by the legal provision.
The bank is subject to a capital floor as prescribed in the Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) Guideline of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI). In calculating regulatory capital ratios, there is a requirement to increase total RWA when the capital floor amount calculated under the standardized approach is higher than a similar calculation using the more risk-sensitive advanced approach rules. The capital floor adjustment reflected in our RWA as at October 31, 2022 was $12.6 billion, compared with $2.5 billion as at July 31, 2022.
RWA were $364.0 billion as at October 31, 2022, an increase from $351.7 billion as at July 31, 2022. RWA were higher, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange movements. Increased asset size, driven by lending growth, was largely offset by risk transfer transactions.
The bank's Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 18.4% as at October 31, 2022, an increase from 17.3% as at July 31, 2022, primarily due to the factors impacting the CET1 Capital Ratio and the $1.0 billion Limited Recourse Capital Notes issuance. The bank's Total Capital Ratio was 20.7% as at October 31, 2022, an increase from 19.4% as at July 31, 2022, primarily due to factors impacting the Tier 1 Capital Ratio and the $750 million subordinated note issuance.
The impact of foreign exchange movements on capital ratios was largely offset. BMO's investments in foreign operations are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and the foreign exchange impact of U.S.-dollar-denominated RWA and capital deductions may result in variability in the bank's capital ratios. We may manage the impact of foreign exchange movements on our capital ratios, both based on the current balance sheet and in anticipation of impacts from the announced acquisition of Bank of the West, and did so during the current quarter. Any such activities could also impact our book value and return on equity.
Our Leverage Ratio was 5.6% as at October 31, 2022, an increase from 5.3% at the end of the third quarter of 2022, due to higher Tier 1 Capital, partially offset by higher leverage exposures mainly from the impact of foreign exchange movements and lending growth.
The bank's risk-based Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Ratio and TLAC Leverage Ratio were 33.1% and 10.1%, respectively, as at October 31, 2022, compared with 32.0% and 9.8%, respectively, as at July 31, 2022.
Regulatory Capital Developments
Refer to the Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section of BMO's 2022 Annual Report for a more detailed discussion of regulatory developments.
Regulatory Capital and TLAC
Regulatory capital requirements for BMO are determined in accordance with OSFI's CAR Guideline, which is based on the capital standards developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. TLAC requirements are determined in accordance with OSFI's TLAC Guideline. For more information see the Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section of BMO's 2022 Annual Report.
OSFI's capital and TLAC requirements are summarized in the following table.

The minimum 4.5% CET1 Ratio requirement is augmented by the 3.5% Total Pillar 1 Capital Buffers, which can absorb losses during periods of stress. The Pillar 1 Capital Buffers include a 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer, a 1.0% Common Equity Surcharge for domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) and a Countercyclical Buffer, as prescribed by OSFI (immaterial for the fourth quarter of 2022). If a bank's capital ratios fall within the range of this combined buffer, restrictions on discretionary distributions of earnings (such as dividends, share repurchases and discretionary compensation) would ensue, with the degree of such restrictions varying according to the position of the bank's ratios within the buffer range.

(2)
OSFI requires all D-SIBs to hold a Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) against Pillar 2 risks associated with systemic vulnerabilities. The DSB can range from 0% to 2.5% of total RWA and is currently set at 2.5% as at October 31, 2022. Breaches of the DSB do not result in a bank being subject to automatic constraints on capital distributions.

Other Capital Developments
During the quarter, 2.8 million common shares were issued through the DRIP and the exercise of stock options.
On October 27, 2022, we issued $750 million 6.534% Subordinated Notes (Non-Viability Contingent Capital (NVCC)) through our Canadian Medium-Term Note Program.
On September 13, 2022, we issued $1,000 million 7.325% Limited Recourse Capital Notes, Series 3 (NVCC).
On August 25, 2022, we redeemed all our outstanding 16 million Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate Reset Class B Preferred Shares, Series 42 (NVCC) for an aggregate total of $400 million.
On July 27, 2022, we completed the domestic public offering of $500 million Non-Cumulative 5-Year Fixed Rate Reset Class B Preferred Shares, Series 50 (NVCC).
On June 1, 2022, we redeemed all our outstanding $850 million subordinated debentures, Series I Medium-Term Notes Second Tranche (NVCC) at par, together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding the date fixed for redemption.
On May 25, 2022, we redeemed all our outstanding 20 million Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate Reset Class B Preferred Shares, Series 40 (NVCC) for an aggregate total of $500 million.
On March 29, 2022, we completed a public offering of 20,843,750 common shares for $3,106 million to finance a portion of the purchase price for the announced acquisition of Bank of the West.
On March 15, 2022, we issued $750 million 5.625% Limited Recourse Capital Notes, Series 2 (NVCC).
On February 25, 2022, we redeemed all our outstanding 24 million Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate Reset Class B Preferred Shares, Series 38 (NVCC) for an aggregate total of $600 million.
On January 10, 2022, we completed our U.S. public offering of US$1.25 billion of 3.088% Subordinated Notes (NVCC), due in 2037, through our U.S. Medium-Term Note Program.
On December 3, 2021, we announced our intention, subject to the approval of OSFI and the Toronto Stock Exchange, to purchase for cancellation up to 22.5 million of our common shares under a normal course issuer bid. Together with the announcement of the acquisition of Bank of the West, we noted that we would not proceed with establishing a normal course issuer bid and do not expect to repurchase shares prior to the closing of the acquisition.
Under Canada's Bank Recapitalization (Bail-In) Regime, eligible senior debt issued on, or after September 23, 2018, is subject to statutory conversion requirements. Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation has the power to trigger the conversion of bail-in debt into common shares. This statutory conversion supplements NVCC instruments, which must be converted in full, prior to the conversion of bail-in debt.
If an NVCC trigger event were to occur, our NVCC instruments would be converted into BMO common shares pursuant to automatic conversion formulas, with a conversion price based on the greater of: (i) a floor price of $5.00; and (ii) the current market price of our common shares at the time of the trigger event (calculated using a 10-day weighted average). Based on a floor price of $5.00, these NVCC capital instruments would be converted into approximately 3.9 billion BMO common shares, assuming no accrued interest and no declared and unpaid dividends.
Dividends
On December 1, 2022, BMO announced that the Board of Directors had declared a quarterly dividend on common shares of $1.43 per share, an increase of $0.04 from the prior quarter, and an increase of $0.10 or 8% from the prior year. The dividend is payable on February 28, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 30, 2023. Common shareholders may elect to have their cash dividends reinvested in common shares of BMO, in accordance with the DRIP.
On January 10, 2022, we announced the offering of a 2% discount on the common shares issued from treasury under the dividend reinvestment feature of the DRIP. Commencing with the common share dividend declared for the first quarter of 2022, and subsequently until further notice, common shares under the DRIP will be issued by the bank from treasury with a 2% discount, calculated in accordance with the terms of the DRIP. The discount will not apply to common shares purchased under the "Optional Cash Payment" feature of the DRIP.
For the purposes of the  Income Tax Act (Canada)  and any similar provincial and territorial legislation, BMO designates all dividends paid or deemed to be paid on both its common and preferred shares as "eligible dividends", unless indicated otherwise.

Review of Operating Groups' Performance
How BMO Reports Operating Group Results
BMO reports financial results for its three operating groups, one of which comprises two operating segments, all of which are supported by Corporate Units and Technology and Operations within Corporate Services. Operating segment results include treasury-related allocations in revenue, non-interest expense allocations from Corporate Units and Technology and Operations (T&O) and allocated capital.
BMO employs funds transfer pricing and liquidity transfer pricing between treasury and the operating segments in order to assign the appropriate cost and credit to funds for the appropriate pricing of loans and deposits, and to help assess the profitability performance of each line of business. These practices also capture the cost of holding supplemental liquid assets to meet contingent liquidity requirements, as well as facilitating the management of interest rate risk and liquidity risk within our risk appetite framework and regulatory requirements. We review our transfer pricing methodologies at least annually, to align with our interest rate, liquidity and funding risk management practices.
The costs of Corporate Units and T&O services are largely allocated to the four operating segments, with any remaining amounts retained in Corporate Services. Expenses directly incurred to support a specific operating segment are generally allocated to that operating segment. Other expenses that are not directly attributable to a specific operating segment are allocated across the operating segments, reasonably reflective of the level of support provided to each operating segment. We review these expense allocation methodologies periodically.
Capital is allocated to the operating segments based on the amount of regulatory capital required to support business activities. Unallocated capital is reported in Corporate Services. We review our capital allocation methodologies annually.
Periodically, certain lines of business and units within our organizational structure are realigned to support our strategic priorities. Effective the first quarter of 2022, loans, deposits and revenue in our business banking line of business have been reclassified from Commercial Banking to Personal and Business Banking within Canadian P&C, to align with our organizational structure. In addition, certain expense allocations have been updated to better align with current experience. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current period's presentation.
We analyze revenue at the consolidated level based on GAAP revenue as reported in the audited annual consolidated financial statements, rather than on a taxable equivalent basis (teb), which is consistent with our Canadian banking peer group. Like many banks, BMO analyzes revenue on a teb basis at the operating segment level. Revenue and the provision for income taxes are increased on tax-exempt securities to an equivalent pre-tax basis in order to facilitate comparisons of income between taxable and tax-exempt sources. The offset to the segment teb adjustments is reflected in Corporate Services revenue and provision for income taxes.

Total revenue was $2,547 million, an increase of $243 million or 11% from the prior year. Net interest income increased $249 million or 15%, due to higher loan and deposit balances and higher net interest margins. Non-interest revenue was relatively unchanged as higher deposit fee and card-related revenue were offset by lower gains on investments in our commercial business. Net interest margin of 2.66% increased 3 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by higher deposit margins reflecting the impact of the higher rate environment, partially offset by lower loan margins and loans growing faster than deposits.
Personal and Business Banking revenue increased $183 million or 11%, due to higher net interest income and higher non-interest revenue. Commercial Banking revenue increased $60 million or 9%, due to higher net interest income, partially offset by lower non-interest revenue.
Total provision for credit losses was $174 million, compared with a recovery of $5 million in the prior year. The provision for credit losses on impaired loans was $142 million, an increase of $53 million, due to higher provisions in both Personal and Business Banking and Commercial Banking.

Reported net income decreased $48 million or 5% from the prior quarter. 
Total revenue increased $18 million or 1%. Net interest income increased $23 million or 1%, primarily due to higher balances, partially offset by lower net interest margins. Non-interest revenue was relatively unchanged as higher card-related revenue and deposit fee revenue were offset by lower gains on investments in our commercial business.

Q4 2022 vs. Q4 2021
BMO Wealth Management reported net income was $298 million, compared with $345 million in the prior year. Wealth and Asset Management reported net income was $221 million, a decrease of $66 million or 24% from the prior year and Insurance net income was $77 million, an increase of $19 million or 36%. Divestitures reduced growth in reported net income by 4% and in assets under management by 39%.
Total revenue was $930 million, compared with $1,535 million in the prior year. Revenue, net of CCPB, was $1,299 million, a decrease of $139 million or 10%. Revenue in Wealth and Asset Management was $1,164 million, a decrease of $168 million or 12%, as divestitures and the impact of weaker global markets were partially offset by higher net interest income from higher margins and strong loan and deposit growth, as well as the impact of higher net new client assets. Insurance revenue, net of CCPB, was $135 million, an increase of $29 million or 25% from the prior year, primarily due to benefits from changes in investments to improve asset liability management.
Non-interest expense was $901 million, a decrease of $89 million or 9%, as continued investments in the business, including sales force expansion and higher technology costs, were more than offset by divestitures.
Assets under management of $305.5 billion decreased $217.8 billion or 42%, and assets under administration of $424.2 billion decreased $3.3 billion or 1% from the prior year, primarily due to divestitures and weaker global markets, partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rate movements and higher underlying net new client assets. Average gross loans increased 19% and average deposits increased 6%.
Q4 2022 vs. Q3 2022
Reported net income decreased $26 million or 8% from the prior quarter. Wealth and Asset Management reported net income decreased $42 million or 16% and Insurance net income increased $16 million or 29%.
Total revenue was $930 million, compared with $1,705 million in the prior quarter. Revenue, net of CCPB, increased $7 million or 1% from the prior quarter. Wealth and Asset Management revenue decreased $18 million or 1%, as the impact of weaker global markets was partially offset by higher net interest income from higher margins. Insurance revenue, net of CCPB, increased $25 million or 22%, primarily due to the impact of favourable market movements in the current quarter relative to unfavourable movements in the prior quarter.
Non-interest expense increased $20 million or 2%, primarily due to continued investments in the business, including sales force expansion, and higher technology costs.
Assets under management decreased $5.0 billion or 2% and assets under administration increased $4.3 billion or 1%, reflecting the impact of weaker global markets and favourable foreign exchange rate movements. Average gross loans and deposits increased 3% and 2% respectively.

Q4 2022 vs. Q4 2021
BMO Capital Markets reported net income was $357 million, a decrease of $174 million or 33% from the prior year.
Total revenue was $1,405 million, a decrease of $25 million or 2% from the prior year. Global Markets revenue increased $77 million or 10%, due to higher foreign exchange, commodities and other trading revenue, and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower equities trading revenue, lower net securities gains and lower new debt and equity issuances. Investment and Corporate Banking revenue decreased $102 million or 16%, primarily due to lower underwriting and advisory revenue reflecting the impact of lower levels of client activity in the current market conditions and lower net securities gains, partially offset by higher corporate banking revenue and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.
Total recovery of the provision for credit losses was $18 million, compared with a recovery of $88 million in the prior year. The provision for credit losses on impaired loans was $5 million, compared with a recovery of $9 million in the prior year. There was a $23 million recovery of the provision for credit losses on performing loans in the current quarter, compared with a recovery of $79 million in the prior year.
Non-interest expense was $965 million, an increase of $156 million or 19% from the prior year, primarily due to continued investments in the business, higher employee-related costs and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.
Average gross loans and acceptances increased $12.7 billion or 22% from the prior year to $71.5 billion, due to higher lending activity across loan portfolios and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by the impact of the deconsolidation of our customer securitization vehicle in the United States and the wind-down of our non-Canadian energy portfolio.
Q4 2022 vs. Q3 2022
Reported net income increased $95 million or 36% from the prior quarter.
Total revenue increased $141 million or 11% from the prior quarter. Global Markets revenue increased $38 million or 4%, due to higher interest rate trading revenue and other trading revenue, as well as the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower equities trading revenue and lower net securities gains. Investment and Corporate Banking revenue increased $103 million or 23%, driven by lower markdowns on loan underwriting commitments, higher corporate banking-related revenue, as well as higher underwriting and advisory revenue, partially offset by lower net securities gains.
Total recovery of the provision for credit losses was $18 million, compared with a recovery of $7 million in the prior quarter. The provision for credit losses on impaired loans was $5 million, compared with a recovery of $22 million in the prior quarter. There was a $23 million recovery of the provision for credit losses on performing loans in the current quarter, compared with a provision of $15 million in the prior quarter.
Non-interest expense increased $45 million or 5% from the prior quarter, driven by higher employee-related costs, net of severance costs in the prior quarter, and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.
Average gross loans and acceptances increased $7.3 billion or 11% from the prior quarter, due to higher lending activity across our loan portfolios and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.

Corporate Services consists of Corporate Units and Technology and Operations (T&O). Corporate Units provide enterprise-wide expertise, governance and support in a variety of areas, including strategic planning, risk management, treasury, finance, legal and regulatory compliance, including sustainability, human resources, communications, marketing, real estate, and procurement. T&O develops, monitors, manages and maintains governance of information technology, including data and analytics, and also provides cyber security and operations services.
The costs of Corporate Units and T&O services are largely allocated to the four operating segments (Canadian P&C, U.S. P&C, BMO Wealth Management and BMO Capital Markets), with any remaining amounts retained in Corporate Services results. As such, Corporate Services results largely reflect the impact of residual treasury-related activities, the elimination of taxable equivalent adjustments, and residual unallocated expenses.
Q4 2022 vs. Q4 2021
Corporate Services reported net income was $2,251 million, compared with a reported net loss of $159 million in the prior year. Results in the current quarter included the impact of the announced acquisition of Bank of the West, including a gain related to the management of the impact of interest rate changes between the announcement and the closing of the acquisition on its fair value and goodwill, and related acquisition and integration costs. In addition, reported results included the impact of a legal provision related to a lawsuit associated with a predecessor bank, M&I Marshall and Ilsley Bank.
Adjusted net loss of $104 million excluded the above factors and was relatively unchanged from the prior year.
Q4 2022 vs. Q3 2022
Reported net income was $2,251 million, compared with a reported net loss of $754 million in the prior quarter. Results increased primarily due to higher revenue related to the fair value management actions, partially offset by the impact of the legal provision. Adjusted net loss was $104 million, compared with an adjusted net income of $7 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted results decreased, primarily due to lower revenue, including lower securities gains, and higher expenses.

Glossary of Financial Terms
Adjusted Earnings and Measures
- Adjusted Revenue  – calculated as revenue excluding the impact of certain non-recurring items, and adjusted net revenue is adjusted revenue, net of CCPB, as set out in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.

- Adjusted Non-Interest Expense  – calculated as non-interest expense excluding the impact of certain non-recurring items, as set out in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.

- Adjusted Net Income –  calculated as net income excluding the impact of certain non-recurring items, as set out in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.

Management considers both reported and adjusted results to be useful in assessing underlying ongoing business performance.
Adjusted Effective Tax Rate  is calculated as adjusted provision for income taxes divided by adjusted income before provision for income taxes.
Allowance for Credit Losses  represents an amount deemed appropriate by management to absorb credit-related losses on loans and acceptances and other credit instruments, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. Allowance on Performing Loans is maintained to cover impairment in the existing portfolio for loans that have not yet been individually identified as impaired. Allowance on Impaired Loans is maintained to reduce the carrying value of individually identified impaired loans to the expected recoverable amount.
Assets under Administration and Assets under Management  refers to assets administered or managed by a financial institution that are beneficially owned by clients and therefore not reported on the balance sheet of the administering or managing financial institution.
Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP)  is a short-term investment. The commercial paper is backed by assets such as trade receivables, and is generally used for short-term financing needs.
Average annual total shareholder return (TSR)  represents the average annual total return earned on an investment in BMO common shares made at the beginning of a fixed period. The return includes the change in share price and assumes dividends received were reinvested in additional common shares.
Average Earning Assets  represents the daily average balance of deposits at central banks, deposits with other banks, securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, securities, and loans over a one-year period.
Average Net Loans and Acceptances  is the daily or monthly average balance of loans and customers' liability under acceptances, net of the allowance for credit losses, over a one-year period.
Bail-In Debt  is senior unsecured debt subject to the Canadian Bail-In Regime. Bail-in debt includes senior unsecured debt issued directly by the bank on or after September 23, 2018, which has an original term greater than 400 days and is marketable, subject to certain exceptions. Some or all of this debt may be statutorily converted into common shares of the bank under the Bail-In Regime if the bank enters resolution.
Bankers' Acceptances (BAs)  are bills of exchange or negotiable instruments drawn by a borrower for payment at maturity and accepted by a bank. BAs constitute a guarantee of payment by the bank and can be traded in the money market. The bank earns a "stamping fee" for providing this guarantee.
Basis Point  is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital  comprises common shareholders' equity net of deductions for goodwill, intangible assets, pension assets, certain deferred tax assets and other items, which may include a portion of expected credit loss provisions.
Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio  is calculated as CET1 Capital, which comprises common shareholders' equity, net of deductions for goodwill, intangible assets, pension assets, certain deferred tax assets and other items, which may include a portion of expected credit loss provisions, divided by risk-weighted assets. The CET1 Ratio is calculated in accordance with OSFI's Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) Guideline.
Common Shareholders' Equity  is the most permanent form of capital. For regulatory capital purposes, common shareholders' equity comprises common shareholders' equity, net of capital deductions.
Credit and Counterparty Risk  is the potential for credit loss due to the failure of an obligor (i.e., a borrower, endorser, guarantor or counterparty) to repay a loan or honour another predetermined financial obligation.
Derivatives  are contracts, requiring no initial or little investment, with a value that is derived from movements in underlying interest or foreign exchange rates, equity or commodity prices or other indices. Derivatives are used to transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks from changes in rates and prices.
Dividend Payout Ratio  represents common share dividends as a percentage of net income available to common shareholders. It is computed by dividing dividends per share by basic earnings per share. Adjusted dividend payout ratio is calculated in the same manner, using adjusted net income.
Earnings per Share (EPS)  is calculated by dividing net income, after deducting preferred share dividends and distributions on other equity instruments, by the average number of common shares outstanding. Adjusted EPS is calculated in the same manner, using adjusted net income. Diluted EPS, which is BMO's basis for measuring performance, adjusts for possible conversions of financial instruments into common shares if those conversions would reduce EPS, and is more fully explained in Note 23 of the consolidated financial statements.
Earnings Sensitivity  is a measure of the impact of potential changes in interest rates on the projected 12-month pre-tax net income of a portfolio of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions in response to prescribed parallel interest rate movements, with interest rates floored at zero.
Economic Capital  is an expression of the enterprise's capital demand requirement relative to its view of the economic risks in its underlying business activities. It represents management's estimation of the likely magnitude of economic losses that could occur should severely adverse situations arise. Economic capital is calculated for various types of risk, including credit, market (trading and non-trading), operational non-financial, business and insurance, based on a one-year time horizon using a defined confidence level.
Economic Value Sensitivity  is a measure of the impact of potential changes in interest rates on the market value of a portfolio of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions in response to prescribed parallel interest rate movements, with interest rates floored at zero.
Efficiency Ratio (or Expense-to-Revenue Ratio)  is a measure of productivity. It is calculated as non-interest expense divided by total revenue, on a taxable equivalent basis in the operating groups),expressed as a percentage.
Efficiency Ratio, net of CCPB , is calculated as non-interest expense divided by total revenue, net of insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities (CCPB).The adjusted efficiency ratio, net of CCPB, is calculated in the same manner, utilizing adjusted revenue, net of CCPB, and adjusted non-interest expense.
Environmental and Social Risk  is the potential for loss or harm, directly or indirectly, resulting from environmental or social factors that impact BMO or its customers,and BMO's impact on the environment.
Fair Value  is the amount of consideration that would be agreed upon in an arm's-length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties who are under no compulsion to act in an orderly market transaction.
Forwards and Futures  are contractual agreements to either buy or sell a specified amount of a currency, commodity, interest-rate-sensitive financial instrument or security at a specified price and date in the future. Forwards are customized contracts transacted in the over-the-counter market. Futures are transacted in standardized amounts on regulated exchanges and are subject to daily cash margin requirements.
Gross impaired loans and acceptances (GIL)  are calculated as the credit impaired balance of loans and customers' liability under acceptances, excluding purchased credit impaired loans.
Hedging  is a risk management technique used to neutralize, manage or offset interest rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity or credit risk exposures arising from normal banking activities.

Net Non-Interest Revenue  is non-interest revenue, net of insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities (CCPB).
Net Promoter Score (NPS)  is the percentage of surveyed customers who would  recommend BMO to a friend or colleague. Data is gathered in a survey that uses a 0–10 point scale. "Detractors" are defined as those who provide a rating of 0–6, "Passives" are defined as those who provide a rating of 7 or 8, and "Promoters" are defined as those who provide a rating of 9 or 10. The NPS score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of "Detractors" from the percentage of "Promoters".
Notional Amount  refers to the principal amount used to calculate interest and other payments under derivative contracts. The principal amount does not change hands under the terms of a derivative contract, except in the case of cross-currency swaps.
Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments  consist of a variety of financial arrangements offered to clients, which include credit derivatives, written put options, backstop liquidity facilities, standby letters of credit, performance guarantees, credit enhancements, commitments to extend credit, securities lending, documentary and commercial letters of credit, and other indemnifications.

Operating Leverage, net of CCPB , is the difference between revenue, net of CCPB (net revenue), and non-interest expense growth rates. Adjusted net operating leverage is the difference between adjusted revenue, net of CCPB, and adjusted non-interest expense growth rates. The bank evaluates performance using adjusted revenue, net of CCPB.
Operational Non-Financial Risk (ONFR)  encompasses a wide range of non-financial risks, including those related to business change, customer trust, reputation and data that can result in financial loss. These losses can stem from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human error or misconduct, and external events that may directly or indirectly impact the fair value of assets we fold in our credit or investment portfolios. Examples of these risks include cyber and cloud security risk, technology risk, fraud risk, business continuity risk and human resources risk, but exclude legal and regulatory risk, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and other types of financial risk.
Options  are contractual agreements that convey to the purchaser the right but not the obligation to either buy or sell a specified amount of a currency, commodity, interest-rate-sensitive financial instrument or security at a fixed future date or at any time within a fixed future period.
Pre-Provision, Pre-Tax Earnings (PPPT)  is calculated as income before the provision for income taxes and provision for/(recovery of) for credit losses. We use PPPT on both a reported and adjusted basis to assess our ability to generate sustained earnings growth excluding credit losses, which are impacted by the cyclical nature of a credit cycle.
Provision for Credit Losses (PCL)  is a charge to income that represents an amount deemed adequate by management to fully provide for impairment in a portfolio of loans and acceptances and other credit instruments, given the composition of the portfolio, the probability of default, the economic environment and the allowance for credit losses already established. PCL can comprise both a provision for credit losses on impaired loans and a provision for credit losses on performing loans. For more information, refer to the Credit and Counterparty Risk - Provision for Credit Losses and Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments–  Allowance for Credit Losses sections and Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements.
Reputation Risk  is the potential for loss or harm to the BMO brand. It can arise even if other risks are managed effectively.
Return on Equity or Return on Common Shareholders' Equity (ROE)  is calculated as net income, less preferred dividends and distributions on other equity instruments, as a percentage of average common shareholders' equity. Common shareholders' equity comprises common share capital, contributed surplus, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and retained earnings. Adjusted ROE is calculated using adjusted net income rather than net income.
Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE)  is calculated as net income available to common shareholders, adjusted for the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, as a percentage of average tangible common equity. Adjusted ROTCE is calculated using adjusted net income rather than net income.
Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) are defined as on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures that are risk-weighted based on guidelines established by OSFI. The measure is used for capital management and regulatory reporting purposes.
Securities Borrowed or Purchased under Resale Agreements  are low-cost, low-risk instruments, often supported by the pledge of cash collateral, which arise from transactions that involve the borrowing or purchasing of securities.
Securities Lent or Sold under Repurchase Agreements  are low-cost, low-risk liabilities, often supported by cash collateral, which arise from transactions that involve the lending or selling of securities.
Securitization  is the practice of selling pools of contractual debts, such as residential mortgages, auto loans and credit card debt obligations, to third parties or trusts, which then typically issue a series of asset-backed securities to investors to fund the purchase of the contractual debts. 
Strategic Risk  arises from the possibility that the bank could experience financial loss or other types of harm due to changes in the external business environment and failure to respond effectively to these changes as a result of inaction, inappropriate strategies or poor implementation of strategies. Strategic risk also includes business risk, which arises from the specific business activities of the enterprise, and the effects these could have on its earnings. 
Stressed Value at Risk (SVaR)  measures the maximum loss likely to be experienced in the trading and underwriting portfolios, measured at a 99% confidence level over a one-day holding period, with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a period of significant financial stress. SVaR is calculated for specific classes of risk in BMO's trading and underwriting activities related to interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, equity and commodity prices and their implied volatilities.
Structured Entities (SEs)  include entities for which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in determining control of the entity. BMO is required to consolidate a SE if it controls the entity by having power over the entity, exposure to variable returns as a result of its involvement and the ability to exercise power to affect the amount of those returns.
Structural (Non-Trading) Market Risk  comprises  interest rate risk arising from banking activities (loans and deposits) and foreign exchange risk arising from foreign currency operations and exposures.
Swaps  are contractual agreements between two parties to exchange a series of cash flows. The various swap agreements that BMO enters into are as follows:
- Commodity swaps  – counterparties generally exchange fixed-rate and floating rate payments based on a notional value of a single commodity.

- Credit default swaps  – one counter party pays the other a fee in exchange for an agreement by the other counterparty to make a payment if a credit event occurs, such as bankruptcy or failure to pay.

- Cross-currency interest rate swaps  – fixed rate and floating-rate interest payments and principal amounts are exchanged in different currencies. Cross-currency swaps – fixed-rate interest payments and principal amounts are exchanged in different currencies.

- Equity swaps  – counterparties exchange the return on an equity security or a group of equity securities for a return based on a fixed or floating interest rate or the return on another equity security or group of equity securities.

- Interest rate swaps  – counterparties generally exchange fixed-rate and floating rate interest payments based on a notional value in a single currency.

- Total return swaps  – one counterparty agrees to pay or receive from the other cash amounts based on changes in the value of a reference asset or group of assets, including any returns such as interest earned on these assets, in exchange for amounts that are based on prevailing market funding rates.

Tangible Common Equity  is calculated as common shareholders' equity, less goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets, net of related deferred tax liabilities.
Taxable Equivalent Basis (teb):  Operating group revenue is presented on a taxable equivalent basis (teb). Revenue and the provision for income taxes are increased on tax-exempt securities to an equivalent pre-tax basis to facilitate comparisons of income between taxable and tax-exempt sources. The effective tax rate is also analyzed on a teb basis for consistency of approach, with the offset to operating segment adjustments recorded in Corporate Services. 
Tier 1 Capital comprises CET1 Capital and  Additional Tier 1 (AT1) Capital . AT1 Capital consists of preferred shares and other AT1 Capital instruments, less regulatory deductions.
Tier 1 Capital Ratio  reflects Tier 1 Capital divided by risk-weighted assets.
Tier 2 Capital  comprises subordinated debentures and may include certain credit loss provisions, less regulatory deductions.
Total Capital  includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital.
Total Capital Ratio  reflects Total Capital divided by risk-weighted assets.
Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)  comprises Total Capital and senior unsecured debt subject to the Canadian Bail-In Regime, less regulatory deductions. The largest Canadian banks are required to meet the minimum TLAC Ratio and TLAC Leverage Ratio effective November 1, 2021, as calculated under OSFI's TLAC Guideline.
Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Ratio  reflects TLAC divided by risk-weighted assets.
Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Leverage Ratio  reflects TLAC divided by leverage exposures.
Total Shareholder Return:  The annual total shareholder return (TSR) represents the average annual total return earned on an investment in BMO common shares made at the beginning of the respective period. The return includes the change in share price and assumes dividends received were reinvested in additional common shares.
Trading and Underwriting Market Risk  is associated with buying and selling financial products in the course of meeting customer requirements, including market-making and related financing activities, and assisting clients to raise funds by way of securities issuance.
Trading-Related Revenue  includes net interest income and non-interest revenue earned from on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions undertaken for trading purposes. The management of these positions typically includes marking them to market on daily basis. Trading-related revenue also includes income (expense) and gains (losses) from both on-balance sheet instruments and interest rate, foreign exchange (including spot positions), equity, commodity and credit contracts.
Value-at-Risk (VaR)  measures the maximum loss likely to be experienced in the trading and underwriting portfolios, measured at a 99% confidence level over a one-day holding period. VaR is calculated for specific classes of risk in BMO's trading and underwriting activities related to interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, equity and commodity prices and their implied volatilities.

TORONTO, Dec. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - Bank of Montreal (TSX: BMO) (NYSE: BMO) today announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.43 per share on paid-up common shares of Bank of Montreal for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 ("Q1 2023 Dividend"), a 4 cent, or 3 per cent, increase from the prior quarter, up 8 per cent from the prior year.
The Board of Directors also declared dividends of:
- $0.24075 per share on paid-up Class B Preferred Shares Series 27;

- $0.240688 per share on paid-up Class B Preferred Shares Series 31;
- $0.190875 per share on paid-up Class B Preferred Shares Series 33;
- $0.303125 per share on paid-up Class B Preferred Shares Series 44; and
- $0.31875 per share on paid-up Class B Preferred Shares Series 46.

The dividend on the common shares is payable on February 28, 2023, to shareholders of record on January 30, 2023. The dividends on the preferred shares are payable on February 27, 2023, to shareholders of record on January 30, 2023.
The above-mentioned dividends on the common and preferred shares are designated as "eligible" dividends for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and any similar provincial and territorial legislation.
Common shareholders may elect to have their cash dividends reinvested in common shares of the Bank in accordance with the Bank's Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan (the "Plan"). 
As previously announced, and until further notice, such additional common shares will be issued from treasury with a two percent discount from the Average Market Price (as defined in the Plan). The discount will not apply to common shares purchased under the "Optional Cash Payment" feature of the Plan.
For existing members of the Plan, the discount will automatically be applied to the reinvestment of the Q1 2023 Dividend. For registered shareholders who wish to participate in the Plan and thereby receive the two percent discount in respect of the Q1 2023 Dividend, Enrolment Forms must be received by the Bank's transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company of Canada, by the close of business on February 1, 2023. Beneficial or non-registered holders must contact their financial institution or broker well in advance of the above date for instructions on how to participate.

Full text: NEW YORK, Dec. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in International Game Technology PLC ("IGT" or the "Company") (NYSE: IGT) of a class action securities lawsuit.

WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in IGT during the relevant time frame, you have until December 13, 2022  to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

Full text: NEW YORK, Dec. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Freshworks Inc. ("Freshworks" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: FRSH) of a class action securities lawsuit.
CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Freshworks investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud.

Full text: NEW YORK, Dec. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Torrid Holdings Inc. ("Torrid" or the "Company") (NYSE: CURV) of a class action securities lawsuit.
CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Torrid investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud. This lawsuit is on behalf of all persons who purchased Torrid common stock in or traceable to the Company's July 2021 initial public offering. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team:
https://www.zlk.com/pslra-1/torrid-holdings-class-action-submission-form?prid=34168&wire=4
CURV  investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500.
CASE DETAILS: The filed complaint alleges that defendants made false statements and/or concealed that: (i) in the first half of 2021, Torrid had experienced a temporary surge in demand as a result of changed consumer behaviors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and government stimulus and that such ephemeral demand trends had dissipated and were not internally projected to continue following the initial public offering ("IPO"); (ii) Torrid was suffering from severe supply chain disruptions caused by the emergence of the Delta variant of COVID-19, which had first emerged in May 2021; (iii) Torrid was running materially below historical inventory levels as a result of supply chain disruptions; (iv) as a result, Torrid did not have sufficient inventory to meet expected consumer demand for its fiscal third quarter of 2021; (v) as a result, late inventory arrival had materially impaired the Company from effectively matching consumer buying trends, creating an undisclosed risk of increased markdowns and promotional activities necessary to sell undesirable inventory; (vi) Torrid's Chief Financial Office planned to retire shortly after the IPO; and (vii) as a result of the above, representations made in the Company's registration statement regarding Torrid's historical financial and operational metrics and purported market opportunities did not accurately reflect the actual business, operations, financial results, and trajectory of the Company at the time of the IPO, and were materially false and misleading and lacked a reasonable factual basis.
WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Torrid during the relevant time frame, you have until January 17, 2023  to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.
NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.

Full text: NEW YORK, Dec. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in PayPal Holdings, Inc. ("PayPal" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: PYPL) of a class action securities lawsuit.

PYPL  investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500.
CASE DETAILS: The filed complaint alleges that defendants made false statements and/or concealed that: (1) defendants had inflated the Company's vitally important Net New Active Accounts metric guidance through an usually large use of marketing campaigns that were easily susceptible to fraud; i.e. the creation of millions of illegitimate accounts which were created for the sole purpose of taking advantage of cash incentives for account creation; (2) defendants used these marketing campaigns and other incentives to hide the Company's true churn rate and declining levels of engagement with the platform; and (3) as a result, defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and /or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.
WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in PayPal during the relevant time frame, you have until December 5, 2022  to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.
NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.
WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases.

Full text: Official Opening of EWP-EDF One Project in Israel Nears; Company Creating Strong U.S Presence Via Upcoming AltaSea Pilot at the Port of Los Angeles, While Reinforcing its Planned Projects in Europe
STOCKHOLM, Dec. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Eco Wave Power Global AB (publ) ("Eco Wave Power" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: WAVE), a leading, publicly traded onshore wave energy technology company that developed a patented, smart and cost-efficient technology for turning ocean and sea waves into green electricity, today provided a corporate update and reported financial results as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022.
Management Commentary
"Eco Wave Power's onshore and nearshore technology is much simpler than legacy offshore wave energy generation technologies and is thus cost-effective, creating the potential to tap thousands of miles of shoreline and utilize hundreds of thousands of breakwaters, jetties, piers, and other marine structures to create clean, renewable, energy from the ocean. As a result, Eco Wave Power is expeditiously advancing with its core projects in Israel, the United States, and the European Union, while simultaneously operating towards the creation of legal frameworks and policies meant to accelerate the implementation and adoption of the wave energy sector," commented Inna Braverman, Founder and Chief Executive Officer.
"Our EWP-EDF One project in Jaffa Port Israel (in collaboration and co-investment from the Israeli Energy Ministry and EDF Renewables IL) nears completion, and on November 28th, the project was visited by the Director of Engineering Supervision of Low and High Voltage from the Israeli Electric Authority to instruct the Company regarding the final electrical inspection necessary for Eco Wave Power to receive the approval of sending electricity from the waves to the Israeli national electric grid for the first time in the history of Israel," commented Ms. Braverman.
Simultaneously, the energy conversion unit of Eco Wave Power's pioneering technology and the first floater have arrived, fully assembled, to the Port of Los Angeles, and are currently being set up as a static display by Eco Wave Power's engineering team, which arrived in Los Angeles to accelerate the process. After a pre-defined time in which the conversion unit will serve for educational purposes to all relevant entities in AltaSea in the Port of Los Angeles, the Company will produce seven additional floaters in California, to be installed on a dedicated real-conditions site within the Port, serving as the first Eco Wave Power implementation in the United States, and creating wave energy related workplaces in the region.
In Europe, Eco Wave Power is also showing significant progress. In Portugal, after obtaining the licenses for the operation and grid connection of the first 1MW in the city of Porto from Direção-Geral de Energia e Geologia (DGEG), the Company has retained the services of Efiki Partners, to produce a social-economic report for its' first 1MW, which will enable the Company to receive the final required license for the project, the Título de Utilização de Recursos Hídricos (TURH) license , which is expected to be granted by Administração dos Portos do Douro, Leixões e Viana do Castelo, SA (APDL) (the site owner) once report is completed, to the satisfaction of all parties.
In Port Adriano in Spain, as per the terms of the Concession Agreement which was entered between the Company and Port Adriano in April 2022, the Company has commenced an in-depth feasibility study in the Port. Once the study is fully completed with favorable results, the parties will enter discussions regarding the licensing requirements and financial terms of the planned 2MW project. In the interim, the Port has been awarded the prestigious Innovation Award by the Port Authority of the Balearic Islands. The prize recognizes the best idea linked to technological progress that has been projected or implemented in any port of the Balearic Islands during this year.
The originality, feasibility, and the technological contribution to solving problems or inefficiencies in ports and marinas in terms of environment and safety have been the elements that were valued by the jury of the Innovation Award, which decided to award Port Adriano for its planned implementation of the Eco Wave Power's pioneering technology.
At the same time, the Company has also signed a feasibility study agreement for a potential 1MW project in Morocco, to be finalized in the next few months. The project is expected to move forward upon favorable results from the feasibility study for the selected site.  
Ms. Braverman added that, "It is interesting that once Gibraltar adopted legislation and enabled implementation of our wave energy technology, it served as an immediate catalyst for neighboring jurisdictions to do the same. Portugal, Spain and Morocco are all countries that neighbor Gibraltar and have all entered different agreements with Eco Wave Power for the promotion of our pioneering technology in their respective countries. I have always commented that one of the most significant barriers for the commercialization of wave energy is lack of wave energy related regulations and legislation, and the case of Gibraltar makes me extremely optimistic, as I am seeing that a good project is 'contagious', and once we execute a project in one country, other countries will follow, thereby slowly removing this barrier."
The Company is also progressing with different R&D grants that have been secured in the past and continues to receive new grants. This includes the grant from Innovate UK in collaboration with the University of Queen Marry in London, The Green Deal grant secured by the ILIAD consortium,  Eco Wave Power's participation in a grant for the production of an in-depth feasibility study for a 1MW wave energy power plant in Halki island in Greece, a grant for Eco Wave Power's participation for the planning of a project in Heraklion Port in Greece, and a new grant by ERDF (European Union Regional Development Fund)  called "Ports Towards Energy Self Sufficiency" (PORTOS) that was approved for a research project in Porto, led by the University of Porto, on November 24, 2022.
"The above shows that world governments continue to embrace clean energy as key to our economic vitality," said Ms. Braverman. "Our progress in Europe and the U.S., combined with new policies that are being adopted, and new grants obtained for wave energy research and implementation reinforces the rising commitment for the commercialization of wave energy. We believe that as our technology becomes more widely adopted, it will lead to wave energy commercialization, and the acceptance of wave energy, as a significant part of the world's renewable energy mix."
"I have been highlighting the importance of the wave energy sector at high profile events around the world, including the WIRED Impact Conference in London, and each engagement creates more believers. The hard work of 2022 is expected to translate to growth in 2023," concluded Ms. Braverman
First Nine Months 2022 Financial Overview
- For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, revenues were $26,000 compared to $31,000 in the same period last year, with revenue in both periods related to feasibility study services in Asia. The Company is building out a pipeline of ancillary technology services that it may provide to its customers and other parties, such as other companies and research institutions, in addition to the Company's WEC technology. These services currently include feasibility studies for potential clients of WEC technology.
- Operating expenses were $2.8 million, up 32% year-over-year.
- Research and development expenses were $755,000 compared to $516,000 in the same period last year. Research and development costs increased due to a non-recurring loss of $278,000 pertaining to a disposal of the floater mechanisms of the Gibraltar wave energy array, due to the relocation of the Gibraltar Conversion Unit to the Port of Los Angeles. The floater mechanisms of the Gibraltar power station were sent to steel recycling, while the conversion unit was fully overhauled and refurbished and shipped to Los Angeles. Eco Wave Power intends to develop and supply new and upgraded floaters for its planned pilot in AltaSea's premises in the Port of Los Angeles, to optimally meet the local marine conditions.
- Sales and marketing expenses were $435,000 compared to $314,000 in the same period last year.
- General and administrative expenses were $1,610,000 compared to $1,290,000 in the same period last year. This increase was mainly the result of an increase in insurance costs as well as an increase in professional services expenditures associated with the capital reorganization in 2021.
- Other income of $18,000 was generated mainly from management fees in a joint venture.

- Operating loss was $2.8 million compared to $2.1 million in the same period last year.
- Net loss was $2.0 million, or $0.05 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1.8 million, or $0.05 per basic and diluted share in the same period last year.
- The Company ended the period with $10.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits as of September 30, 2022, compared to $14.6 million as of December 31, 2021.

Full text: Grid Connect and Emotas' webinar offers a high-level tour of three CAN protocols for developers and engineers implementing automotive and industrial projects.
NAPERVILLE, Ill., Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- On Dec. 1, 2022, at 10:30 a.m. CT, Grid Connect, Inc. and its partner Emotas Embedded Communication GmbH, a Germany-based software developer, will co-host a webinar to give engineers working with automobiles, diesel engines, and industrial machines practical know-how and must-know tips about controller area network protocols CANopen, SAE J1939, and UDS. These higher layer CAN protocols are standards for designing and using technology to transmit information between components. For example, J1939 provides serial data communication between microprocessor systems in heavy-duty vehicles.
"Our webinar offers a high-level tour of three protocols and is valuable for developers and engineers who want to implement these protocols as part of their projects," said Rick Rockershousen, vice president of Grid Connect.
"Protocols like J1939 facilitate the communication of data like speed, oil temperature, or torque, and any of our customers who've purchased a CAN product will benefit from hearing how these devices relate to the higher-level standards we'll cover," added Torsten Gedenk, managing director for Emotas.
The webinar's co-hosts, Rockershousen and Gedenk, will:
- Review, at a high level, CAN bus basics
- Discuss three, higher layer protocols (i.e., CANopen, SAE J1939, and UDS), and
- Field questions from attendees.

For approximately 20 years, Gedenk has specialized in software development with a focus on standards such as CANopen, J1939, EtherCAT and others. His expertise also includes advising clients about protocol stacks, drivers, and high-tech tools for CAN and EtherCAT.
Rockershousen is an expert on embedded and networking technologies. He holds a master's degree in management information systems from Benedictine University and a bachelor's in computer engineering from the University of Michigan.

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- 
WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, continues its investigation of potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of The Gap, Inc. (NYSE: GPS) resulting from allegations that Gap, Inc. may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public.
SO WHAT:  If you purchased Gap, Inc. securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. The Rosen Law Firm is preparing a class action seeking recovery of investor losses.
WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the prospective class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=6662 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT:  On May 20, 2022, during trading hours, The Wall Street Journal published an article entitled "Old Navy Made Clothing Sizes for Everyone. It Backfired. The clothing brand's push for inclusivity left it with a shortage of middle sizes. 'It's super-frustrating.'" The article stated that "Old Navy set out to make clothes shopping more inclusive for women of all body types. It ended up with too many extra-small and extra-large items and too few of the rest, a mismatch that frustrated customers and contributed to falling sales and a management shake-up." Further, the article stated that "Gap warned that sales for the spring quarter would fall short of expectations in part due to troubles at Old Navy[,]" but that "[t]he extended sizes were the culprit, according to current and former employees." Finally, the article stated that "Old Navy's stumbles don't bode well for Gap Inc. In 2021, Old Navy accounted for 54% of the company's sales and roughly 80% of profits[.]"
On this news, Gap Inc.'s stock fell 5% to close at $10.33 per share on May 23, 2022, the next full trading day.
WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel.

Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017.

TAIPEI, Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- NEXCOM, a leading supplier of network appliances, introduces two commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) systems from its new NVR product series: PNSA 3171 and PNSA 3171A. With support for 8 and 24 PoE switch ports respectively, these 1U rackmounts are powered by the Intel® Core™ processor family to provide ample computing power to process data. PNSA 3171 and PNSA 3171A are software- and hardware-ready platforms, designed to reduce the complexity of cabling and maintaining surveillance systems, saving time, money, and resources.
Compared with the legacy way to configure power and network cables for each IP camera, the complexity of cabling is greatly simplified by using PNSA 3171 and PNSA 3171A. Both NVR appliances with video and access management software installed are able to accommodate data from 8/24-channel IP cameras while simultaneously powering them via PoE switch ports, making the surveillance system easier to deploy, and maintain.
NEXCOM's proprietary embedded Atlas OS™ is available for these NVR appliances, providing PoE and switch management functions all in a user-friendly graphical interface. Atlas OS™ also offers application programming interfaces (APIs) for NVR software providers to quickly integrate the PoE switch operations into their own NVR software, reducing the efforts of software developers and speeding up time to market.
Regarding storage features, both NVR appliances come with four swappable 3.5" HDD bays for recording data, upgrading, and maintenance. A slot for M.2 SSD allows installing the operating system without taking up space in the HDDs, hence in case of disk failure, the OS will not be affected. For more information, please visit PNSA 3171 and PNSA 3171A product page.

A recognized AWS Rising Star Independent Software Vendor (ISV) Partner of Year 2022 and member of the AWS ISV Accelerate Program, JupiterOne helps organizations, from startups to enterprises, advance their cloud adoption journey and strengthen their security posture.
Below is a summary of key initiatives:
- JupiterOne for AWS Startups + Small Businesses - This new program gives smaller organizations access to JupiterOne at a discounted rate, enabling them to address key security and operational requirements that arise as their businesses grow. Qualifying program participants receive special JupiterOne Fast Start Marketplace Private Offer pricing available only in AWS Marketplace .
 
- Participation in AWS Marketplace Vendor Insights - JupiterOne is an inaugural participant of AWS Marketplace Vendor Insights, a new feature that simplifies third-party software risk assessments for customers by compiling security and compliance information in a unified dashboard. With JupiterOne, customers gain access to evidence related to data privacy and residency, application security, access control, and more, streamlining procurement and accelerating the vendor validation process.
 
- AWS joins as a member of JupiterOne Stellar Partner Program - The program brings together technology providers from key sectors in IT, security, and DevOps to create a modern cloud-based technology stack that simplifies day-to-day operations for its users while reducing associated costs and resource burnout from the constant toggling between multiple siloed tools. JupiterOne will deliver enhanced value to joint customers through focused co-building and co-selling efforts with AWS.

AWS re:Invent 2022 attendees can learn more about these initiatives and catch a demo of the company's CAASM platform by stopping by the JupiterOne booth (#231). JupiterOne's Senior Solutions Architect, Mauricio Ruiz, delivered a session titled Reducing Exposure in the Cloud (November 29, 2022, at 1:25 pm). In addition, Senior Director of Cloud Alliances, Shane Jones, presented a talk about Cyber Hygiene Strategies for Security Leaders (Wednesday, November 30, 2022, at 10:55 am). Both sessions will be available on-demand throughout December for virtual access. In addition to its booth presence, JupiterOne is co-hosting the "DevOps and Darts" event with GitLab, Sysdig, VMware, and more. The event will take place at the Flight Club in the Venetian Resort on Wednesday, November 30, 2022, starting at 6:30 pm. Interested AWS re:Invent 2022 attendees can register for the event here .
Organizations rely on the cloud to centralize their business operations as they expand. New users, endpoints, applications, code, data, and even whole new environments can be easily added and spun up, often without the knowledge of IT and security teams. With each new asset acting as a possible entry point to an organization's digital environment, the ability to identify, map, analyze, and secure this constantly growing attack surface has become business critical. JupiterOne provides an added layer of visibility and posture management to tens of thousands of AWS accounts, helping organizations further secure their attack surface with continuous asset discovery and attack path analysis to reduce risk, triage incidents, and prioritize vulnerability findings across their AWS environment and beyond.
"As we build and take Udo to the next stage of growth, finding technology vendors that understand our business and technical needs is critical to our success," said Jacob Lambert, Senior DevOps Engineer at Udo. "We are thrilled to leverage the JupiterOne for AWS Startups + Small Businesses program to gain access to the same technology that enterprise companies rely on as the foundation of our cloud infrastructure and security practice, and expect it to be a game-changer for Udo."
"We are thrilled to welcome AWS to the JupiterOne Stellar Partner Program and announce our support for these major initiatives to deliver greater value to our customers," said Erkang Zheng, Founder and CEO at JupiterOne. "We are also honored to have been selected from among 100,000 worldwide AWS Partners to be one of the first to support in AWS Marketplace Vendor Insights feature. JupiterOne and AWS customers stand to win tremendously from these initiatives, and we look forward to increasing our work together for many years to come."
"Our customers tell us they need help finding SaaS software that can be utilized quickly," said said Chris Grusz, General Manager of Worldwide ISV Alliances and AWS Marketplace, AWS. "However, today's paperwork-based process can take weeks and sometimes months. With AWS Marketplace Vendor Insights, customers can reduce the time it takes for assessment while getting access to more up to date information than the traditional paperwork-based approach. Organizations like JupiterOne have shown commitment to trust and transparency for their customers by implementing Vendor Insights."

Such factors are anticipated to drive the growth of the market during the forecast period.

Refurbished smartphone market: Growing number of online platforms dealing in refurbished smartphones is the key trend
- The growing number of online platforms dealing in refurbished smartphones is a key trend in the market.  The market has witnessed the emergence of end-to-end online platforms for buying and selling refurbished smartphones.

Full text: FIVE Hotels and Resorts is the first hotel group to earn the UL Verified SPIRE Smart Buildings Rating.
NORTHBROOK, Ill., Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- UL Solutions, a global leader in applied safety science, today announced that FIVE Hotels and Resorts' FIVE Palm Jumeirah and FIVE Jumeirah Village hotels in Dubai are the first hotels to receive UL Verified SPIRE Smart Buildings™ Ratings. The rating for each building is based on the SPIRE Smart Building Assessment™, an evaluation for smart buildings that results in an overall UL Verified SPIRE Smart Buildings Rating.
The FIVE Palm Jumeirah and FIVE Jumeirah Village hotels each received a three-star UL Verified SPIRE Smart Buildings Rating — among the highest-performing program ratings to date for any building category.
"By becoming the first in the luxury hotel space to achieve SPIRE Smart Building Ratings, FIVE Hotels has taken a significant step in validating and demonstrating smart building innovation at two of their landmark properties," said Sudhi Sinha, vice president of Ecosystems and Service Development group for UL Solutions. "Hotels are complex ecosystems to manage, often with multiple priorities. By assessing, validating and rating key hotel elements that consider the entirety of a smart building, the UL Verified SPIRE Smart Buildings Rating supports FIVE Hotels' commitment to enhancing sustainability and building performance that improve the overall guest experience and help increase asset value. We thank them for putting their trust in UL Solutions to deliver on that promise."
The FIVE Palm Jumeirah and FIVE Jumeirah Village hotels received an in-depth, on-site and virtual audit of each of the building's assets, technologies and processes. To assess for the SPIRE Smart Buildings Ratings, UL Solutions focused on six key, industry-driven building criteria categories that define the full scope of smart building performance, including power and energy, health and well-being, life and property safety, connectivity, cybersecurity and sustainability.
"With the emergence of FIVE as the first hotel group in the world to achieve SPIRE Smart Buildings Ratings for the FIVE Palm Jumeirah and FIVE Jumeirah Village in Dubai, I am humbled by the dedication of the entire FIVE team, which drove environmental and social excellence," said Kabir Mulchandani, founder and chairman, FIVE Hotels and Resorts. "The FIVE ethos is centered around encouraging a community committed to stewarding world-class sustainability. Therefore, the UL Verified SPIRE Smart Buildings Ratings helped FIVE enhance our sustainability scope to now include seamless cybersecurity, digital connectivity and social safety. We are excited to continue to execute immersive entertainment and luxury lifestyle experiences through a sustainability framework founded on science-driven best practices for smart buildings."
The SPIRE Smart Buildings program is the first smart building assessment program that offers an independent analysis of the actual performance of a building. SPIRE evaluates buildings against a curated, multifactor framework developed with insights from more than 60 diverse, industry-leading organizations specialized in the buildings industry. The UL Verified SPIRE Smart Buildings Rating helps empower building operators as they consider smart building needs in the face of new and evolving influences. These include the physical assets decarbonization, business and building mission alignment, occupant experiences, cybersecurity concerns, artificial intelligence, image perception, and robotics being introduced into the built environment. In addition, recent health concerns have brought new priorities to building operators looking for smart building systems to help keep occupants safe. SPIRE assessments provide insight into smart building performance and also help communicate a commitment to the health and well-being of its occupants.

The SPIRE Smart Building Program, the world's first objective assessment and rating program for smart buildings, was created in a partnership between the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and UL Solutions. The SPIRE Smart Building Program provides an assessment of connected technologies within buildings, delivering insights, benchmarks and roadmaps to help lower costs, mitigate risks, create brand differentiation and enhance overall asset value.

Contract cleaning services market: The increased demand for premium skincare products drives the growth
- One of the key factors driving the contract cleaning services market growth is the increase in the number of residential buildings.  Factors such as growing disposable income, rapid industrialization, increasing urbanization, and the progressive rise in investments have fueled the growth of residential construction activities worldwide. Also, rising government support in the form of affordable loans and tax waiver schemes has increased the demand for new houses among consumers. With the increasing number of residential spaces, the demand for contract cleaning services is increasing significantly. All these factors are driving the growth of the global contract cleaning services market.

Contract cleaning services market: The adoption of green cleaning products is the key trend in the market
- The adoption of green cleaning products is one of the key contract cleaning services market trends that is expected to impact the industry positively in the forecast period.  Conventional cleaning agents used in contract cleaning services create an adverse impact on users and the environment. This coupled with increasing consumer awareness of the benefits of using green and eco-friendly products is encouraging vendors to offer sustainable or green cleaning agents. Green cleaning agents do not release harmful aerosols or wastes, which can be detrimental to users and the environment. These agents are also cost-effective as they save resources, such as energy, water, and chemicals, and do not lead to environmental pollution. The increasing adoption of green and sustainable practices by vendors will have a positive impact on the growth of the market during the forecast period.

Full text: Media Contact: Sufyan Al-Hassan, PR Manager, Info-Tech Research Group, salhassan@infotech.com
TORONTO, Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - As digital transformation continues to be a priority for many IT leaders, effective vendor management has become more critical than ever. To support technology teams navigating shifts in vendor relations, Global IT research and advisory firm Info-Tech Research Group has published a new research advisory note titled What Is Vendor Management?  This new research note provides IT professionals an overview of vendor management, its challenges, benefits, and best practices to help organizations develop a practical approach configurable to any situation.
Vendor management has become especially popular in the last five years, despite a history going back more than 25 years. However, the firm's research indicates that although vendor management has evolved over time, its definitions and perceptions are still limited by archaic views.
"Vendor management can mean many different things and is a broad topic," says Steve Jeffery, Principal Research Advisor at Info-Tech Research Group. "Simply put, we define vendor management as   a proactive, holistic, and strategic approach to interacting with vendors from onboarding through offboarding."
According to the firm's research, many organizations are unable to implement a robust vendor management office (VMO), as it can be a large-scale and resource-intensive project. The research found that while many IT teams apply some level of vendor management during their vendor interactions, there is a lack of consistency as each team member's processes, interactions, and negotiations can differ.
To help IT teams create a more consistent and efficient approach to vendor management, Info-Tech developed a Five–Towers–of–Excellence framework. Each Tower is comprised of a process that is separate but complementary to the other Towers.
"Vendor management is the unifying foundation for the five main Towers of Excellence," says Phil Bode, Principal Research Advisor at Info-Tech Research Group. "While it is not necessary to incorporate all of the Towers, the more elements and Towers present in a vendor management initiative, the more strategic and impactful it can become."
This concept breaks down vendor management into five sections, or Towers, of excellence , segmented into the following categories:
- Risk Management Tower – Historically, cybersecurity has been the risk most organizations have focused on. However, when the pandemic hit, third-party risk management and supply-chain risk, including the availability of parts and human resources, also came to the forefront.

- Contract Management Tower – Vendor management includes participating in negotiating the initial contract, amendments and other modifications to the contract, statements of work, and other contract-related documents.

- Financial Management Tower – Collecting and understanding historical, current, and projected expenditures is the first step to exploring a vendor ecosystem and establishing the baseline for tracking forecasted and actual savings, cost avoidance, and value-creation activities.

- Performance Management Tower – Most organizations have at least one underperforming vendor. Without adequate vendor management, organizations are forced to expend more resources to manage the fallout from inadequate remedies.

- Relationship Management Tower – This tower bridges the expanse between the customer, vendor, and the other towers. Relationship management encompasses other topics such as market intelligence, conflict resolution, and vendor alignment with the customer.

According to Info-Tech's research, organizations implementing a vendor management initiative can expect a significant return on investment, more value from their vendor contracts, reduced organizational risk, and improved communication, collaboration, and efficiency.

Full text: From hyper-localized communities and iCommerce to Artificial Influence and  Subscription Services, Influence is set to create a New Order of Brands
NEW YORK , Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- As the value of Influencer marketing increases globally from $1.7BN in 2016 to $16.4BN in 2022, a new report by Ogilvy reveals the influencer marketing trends that will allow brands to build awareness, improve engagement, and drive revenue in 2023. Each of the six trends identified will enable brands to access the burgeoning Influence economy in distinct ways. The full report is available for download here. 
One of the key trends is iCommerce, the Influence economy. TikTok has become the third largest social platform and the most potent cultural and commercial force for today's consumer, and not just Gen Z and Gen Alpha, 36% of users are over 30 years old. TikTokMadeMeBuyIt has 29.3 billion views and is driving iCommerce by testing out live shops which provide brands with unprecedented insight into campaigns from end-to-end. 49% of TikTok users have already reported making a purchase via the platform.
Rahul Titus, Global Head of Influence for Ogilvy PR and lead author of the report, said : "Influencer marketing works because people trust people more than brands. Influence allows brands to connect with audiences in a way no other marketing can – with authenticity. As we head into economic uncertainty, it is imperative that brands are efficient and effective with their spend. Some of these influencer trends like grassroots influence, harnessing the power of hyperlocal, allows brands to circumvent mass-market sale models, and pinpoint their target audience in authentic ways to deliver a more streamlined and less fragile value exchange."
Other trends explored are subscription services and artificial humans. Platforms including OnlyFans and Patreon, are becoming mainstream, this business model will define 2023, unlocking new revenue stream for creators that go beyond paid advertising. Even artificial humans – in the form of AI – are becoming more real. Other trends to watch includes the rise of Health Influence. 40% of people said information found on social media affects how they coped with a chronic condition, their view of diet and exercise, and their selection of a physician — so influencer selection is critical
"Influence doesn't just have a seat at the table, it sits at the head of the table. In an age when consumers are overwhelmed with content through multiple devices, Influence is the new ever evolving frontier of marketing. For consumers, authentic credibility has overtaken hard sales when it comes to increasing trust and growth. Those brands who get this right are poised to reap the benefits of an ever-growing creator economy. The future of Influence is around real people with real stories driving real impact. Own your conversation, or someone else will," Titus added.
Since 2017 Rahul has worked with Ogilvy's Influence team to establish the network's unparalleled leadership and authority around the Influence economy. Ogilvy has continually redefined the industry through their industry-leading thought leadership, launching the network's inclusive influence initiative and unveiling the agency's recent commitment to combat the misuse of beauty and body editing across Influencer content. Ogilvy's Influence expertise has set industry standards and has becoming the most-awarded agency by the Influencer Marketing Awards for the 4th year in a row.

Full text: FOOTHILL RANCH AND IRVINE, Calif., Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Kawasaki Motors Corp., U.S.A., is returning to the AIMExpo show floor, February 15-17, 2023, in Las Vegas with its Dealer Development & Training team to connect and strategize with potential new dealers as it begins to grow its dealer network.
"To be able to meet, face-to-face, with hundreds of dealers from across the country as we kick off the sales year is a tremendous opportunity," said Kawasaki's Alan J. Schapel, senior manager, Dealer Development & Training. "Dealers are often the first point of contact for our consumers — especially new riders — making them one of the most important ambassadors of our products, therefore, it is our priority to ensure that we select only the best new dealers to represent the Kawasaki brand."

Their planned use of this show as a platform to connect with dealer prospects and focus on the B2B side of their business is exactly what AIMExpo is about – connecting the industry with the industry."

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The data center market size is projected to grow by USD 615.96 billion, progressing at a CAGR of 21.98% from 2021 to 2026. By region, the global data center market is segmented into North America, APAC, Europe, South America, and MEA. North America is estimated to contribute 35% to the growth of the global market over the forecast period. The significant increase in the adoption of cloud services by enterprises across industries in countries such as the US and Canada will facilitate the data center market growth in North America over the forecast period.

Data Center Market: The rise in adoption of multi-cloud and network upgrades to support 5G drives the growth.
- One of the key factors driving the global data center market growth is the rise in the adoption of multi-cloud and network upgrades to support 5G . Enterprises are embracing multi-cloud architecture to prevent data loss or downtime due to a localized component failure, ensure security compliances, and meet workload requirements. The demand for the deployment of 4G/5G networks globally is also expected to increase during the forecast period. With the implementation of 5G technologies and the consequent increase in speed, the rate at which data is generated, transmitted, and consumed will grow. This will drive the demand for the upgrade of the existing data center network infrastructure and increase in new data centers constructed closer to the data origins to reduce latency, which will positively impact the market growth in the forecast period. 

Data Center Market: The rise in the adoption of edge computing is the key trend in the market
- The rise in the adoption of edge computing is another major factor supporting the global data center market growth.  The advantage of edge computing is that the stored content is close to the client machine, thereby reducing latency and improving server response. This type of network architecture was initially implemented by SMEs, but the growing demand for efficient and secure data management has spurred its implementation in large-scale enterprises. Market vendors are focusing on developing and introducing new edge computing platforms, which will help clients to improve their data management capabilities at the edge of the network. The growing deployment of edge computing will, thus, spur the demand for edge data centers, and the trend of edge data center deployments will continue during the forecast period.

A recent Harris Poll , among over 2,000 U.S. adults of which nearly 200 are healthcare workers, commissioned by IntelyCare and DailyPay reveals that a majority of healthcare workers across the country say stress about their personal financial situation has had a negative impact on their sleep (64%), mental health (59%), self-esteem (56%), physical health (53%), and relationships at home (53%).
Overall, 68% of healthcare workers find it stressful to manage their finances (56% of Americans overall say the same) with more than half of healthcare workers (52%) feeling less confident about their personal financial situation now compared to a year ago. Looking ahead, 79% of healthcare workers are at least somewhat worried that changes in the economy (e.g., inflation, recession) will have a negative impact on their personal financial situation in the next six months. This is especially concerning given that already 65% of healthcare workers say their household typically lives paycheck-to-paycheck and 48% expect to need a short-term loan in the next six months.
Specifically, the majority of healthcare workers are more worried now compared to a year ago about paying for groceries/food (58%), rent/mortgage (57%), gas for an automobile (56%), and utility bills (53%).
On a positive note, a majority of healthcare workers (71%) say their employer cares about their mental and physical health and the same proportion (71%) say their employer gives them the flexibility they need to manage their personal life during work hours.
But there is an appetite for even more flexibility as a majority of healthcare workers (58%) would be willing to reduce their paycheck for more flexible working hours. Nearly three-quarters (73%) say it is important to them that their employer provides tools and resources to help them manage financial stress.
"With the ongoing healthcare labor shortages plaguing this country, it's very disheartening to see that so many of those who remain are struggling. With inflation and the holidays coming, we need to get smart about how we help our healthcare workers. Hiring bonuses and raises that are offset by rising living costs will not translate to building sustainable workforces," said David Coppins, co-founder and CEO of IntelyCare. "We've spent the last few years at IntelyCare actively listening to our 50,000 nurses and aides. We've had tremendous success in terms of hiring and retention in large part due to offering differentiated financial benefits and working with partners like DailyPay."
The research supports the positive impact an on-demand pay benefit can have on employee recruitment and retention. Among healthcare workers:
- 71% Would Be More Likely to Remain at a Job If Their Employer Offered an On-demand Pay Benefit than If They Didn't Offer One
- 64% say that if they were seeking a new job, they would be more attracted to an employer that offered an on-demand pay benefit than an employer that did not
- 65% say being able to track their earned wages on a daily basis would help alleviate financial stress
- 30% would be willing to reduce their paycheck by 10% or more for more flexible working hours
- 46% do not feel that their employer provides adequate resources or benefits to help them manage financial stress

"Healthcare professionals have given so much of themselves to support their communities, especially over the last few years with the global pandemic," said Kevin Coop, Chief Executive Officer, DailyPay. "We are proud to partner with healthcare companies nationwide who are doing all they can to support their selfless team members with impactful benefits to help mitigate the negative effects of inflation."
There are other avenues for healthcare organizations to consider as well. Answering the call for more scheduling flexibility is one, as 30% of healthcare workers would be willing to reduce their paychecks by 10% or more for more flexible working hours. There's also a need for adequate resources or benefits to help workers manage financial stress, as 46% of healthcare workers do not believe their employer provides this access.
One additional consideration would be to provide supplemental financial support via a charitable not-for-profit organization, similar to IntelyCare's IntelyHeart Foundation.
Survey Methodology: This survey was conducted online within the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of DailyPay & Intelycare from October 4-6, 2022 among 2,068 U.S. adults ages 18 and older, among whom 1,053 are employed full-time or part-time, and 197 are healthcare industry workers. The sampling precision of Harris online polls is measured by using a Bayesian credible interval. For this study, the sample data is accurate to within +/- 2.8 percentage points using a 95% confidence level.

Design Industry's Most Prestigious Awards Program Recognizes Prominent Specialty Design Project by The Gettys Group Companies at Annual Ceremony in New York City
CHICAGO, Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Tribune Tower Residences has been honored in the Specialty Design category of the 2022 Gold Key Awards for Excellence in Hospitality Design. Presented by Boutique Design magazine during the influential Boutique Design New York industry event, the Gold Key Awards honor the world's most innovative hospitality projects. The distinguished Tribune Tower Residences project was selected from more than 325 entries. The Gettys Group Companies, a renowned family of companies based in Chicago and focused on development, branding, interior design and procurement for global hospitality, commercial and multifamily projects, received the award for interior design.
The iconic Tribune Tower, the longtime home of the Chicago Tribune, is a symbol of Chicago's history — and an architectural masterwork on the city's Magnificent Mile. In the 1920s, the building was sculpted upon the ambitious plans of an international design competition winner, resulting in this instantly recognizable Neo-Gothic masterpiece. Nearly 100 years later, The Gettys Group helped to transform the building to its new purpose: a collection of 162 elegant contemporary residences with 56 distinct floor plans and 55,000 square feet of amenities spread out over 6 floors.
Alongside partners Solomon Cordwell Buenz and The Walsh Group, The Gettys Group Companies oversaw the branding, interior design, and procurement for developers Golub and CIM Group.
"Our Interior Design team sought to honor the Tribune Tower's profound past while introducing its new life as a luxury destination for today's urban dweller," said The Gettys Group President Andrew Fay. "Inspired by the building's distinctive architecture, we cultivated spaces that combine history with a modern sensibility to appeal to residents well into the future. We are honored to have this singular project recognized by the esteemed Gold Key awards program and consider ourselves in the design industry's finest company alongside our fellow nominees."
About The Gettys Group Companies The Gettys Group Companies is a family of hospitality-focused companies dedicated to creating inspired moments that stay with guests, residents and tenants, and the defined details that enrich brands.

ROCHESTER, N.Y., Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Rochester, New York's Genesee Keg Tree will be lit this Friday night at 6:30 p.m., two days after the Rockefeller Tree lights up Midtown Manhattan.

NEW HARTFORD, N.Y., Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Poll Highlights
Biden's base has driven up his approval rating, and helped Democrats perform better than expected in the midterm. There was no red wave, and President Biden and Congressional Democrats came out the winners, in the 2022 midterm election, by maintaining control of the U.S. Senate. Although Republicans will have a slim majority in the House of Representatives, Republicans underperformed in many congressional and gubernatorial races across the country.
In our post-election poll of 2,000 midterm voters nationwide, voters expressed discontent with President Biden overall, but his numbers are on the up since our last poll in August, when his job approval rating was 43% approve/55% disapprove. Biden's approval rating among midterm election voters currently sits at 45% approve and 53% disapprove, while 2% were not sure. Biden's base has driven up his approval rating as of late, and surely helped Democrats perform better than expected in some midterm Senate and congressional races. In our poll, the president performed well with majorities of Generation Z (55% approve and 41% disapprove), Millennial (61% approve and 37% disapprove), Hispanic (56% approve and 43% disapprove), African American (68% approve and 28% disapprove), and urban voters in large cities (69% approve and 31% disapprove).
While President Biden and Democrats can rejoice and do a victory lap, due to a great offensive and defensive performance in the midterm election, there are still cracks in their armor. For instance, majorities of voters believe the country is off on the wrong track (61% wrong track/32% right direction), including U.S. economic direction (64% wrong track/29% right direction) and foreign policy direction (53% wrong track/34% right direction). In all three instances, women and suburban women voters were even more likely to think the country, economy, and foreign policy directions were off the wrong track.
Midterm voters also expressed that the issues that mattered the most in who they decided to vote for were inflation (22%), economy/jobs (17%), threats to the democratic process (11%), and reproductive rights (9%).

Investors double-down on creation of new SPaaS (Security Platform-as-a-Service) category
PALO ALTO, Calif., Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pangea Cyber today announced its $26 million Series B funding to accelerate the delivery of its API-based security services. The Series B round is led by GV, with participation from Decibel and Okta Ventures. They join existing investors Ballistic Ventures and SYN Ventures. This brings total funding raised for the one year old company to $52 million. Pangea plans to use the funding for product development and to drive developer and builder adoption.
"Pangea provides a comprehensive set of services for builders, developed by some of the industry's best serial entrepreneurs we've known for over a decade," said Karim Faris, General Partner at GV, who will join Pangea's board as part of the investment. "Incorporating the best security practices today involves choosing from an ambiguous and fragmented set of open source and limited commercial offerings. Pangea's compelling vision will create a new standard for cybersecurity practitioners."
"Development teams simply lack the expertise to add security capabilities into their applications. With up to one million software companies anticipated by 2027 (according to Forrester ), it's essential that the applications they build have access to a trustworthy framework of security functions," said Oliver Friedrichs, Founder and CEO at Pangea. "This new funding will help us to realize and accelerate that vision."
Pangea's Security Platform-as-a-Service framework is available for builders who need to add security functions to their applications. Builders use Pangea to log security events, manage export restrictions, handle personally identifiable information (PII), identify malicious files being shared, and block users from risky internet domains. Services are offered just like Amazon Web Services, but with a focus on cybersecurity, where you can get every security function in one place. Pangea plans on releasing several dozen API-based security services over the next 12 months.
"Every app developer needs to worry about security — but most of them lack the ability to properly choose, deploy and maintain those security building blocks," said Austin Arensberg, Senior Director from Okta Ventures. "Pangea's API-based services are a one-stop shop for all things security. Its plug-and-play platform allows you to easily embed security into your app."
"We've seen PaaS offerings from AWS, GCP, and Azure for compute, storage, and database, and CPaaS from Twilio for communications, but we've not yet seen a similar model for cybersecurity — with simple-to-use security functions that app builders can easily embed to get to market fast. The time is right for the arrival of Security Platform as a Service, or SPaaS," said Barmak Meftah, Co-founder and General Partner at Ballistic Ventures. "We're excited to welcome GV, Decibel, and Okta Ventures onboard as this further validates our initial investment in Pangea."
Pangea is free to get started. Developers can create an account and explore available services at pangea.cloud .
About Pangea Pangea is the world's most comprehensive provider of security services for cloud and mobile app developers, SaaS platform providers, and security operations centers. By making security a core part of every software builder's toolset, Pangea delivers the required security DNA for your organization, reinventing how you deliver a secure customer experience. Pangea is led by co-founders Oliver Friedrichs and Sourabh Satish, the creators behind the award-winning Phantom Cyber SOAR platform, acquired by Splunk in 2018.

Users can now bridge hundreds of Z-Wave and Zigbee devices into their Apple Home app.
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- "Hey Siri, can you integrate with the Hubitat Elevation hub?" With the release of latest Hubitat Elevation platform update, the answer is a resounding "yes!"
The Hubitat Elevation version 2.3.4 update brings a number of enhancements to the robust home automation hub, including the new Apple HomeKit integration. With this integration, the Hubitat Elevation hub can be used as a bridge for countless lights, switches, sensors and other devices that are not natively HomeKit compatible.
"Integrating the Hubitat Elevation hub with Apple Homekit opens up a whole new world of possibilities for Homekit users," said Pete Borchers, Director of Marketing at Hubitat.

- Expand Homekit automation capabilities with Hubitat Elevation hub's extensive built-in apps.

Premium cosmetics market: The increased demand for premium skincare products drives the growth
- One of the key factors driving the premium cosmetics market growth is the increased demand for premium skincare products.  Rising disposable income has encouraged consumers to spend more on premium products. This has led to an increase in the demand for premium cosmetics, especially skincare products. To cater to this growing demand, market vendors are investing in innovative ingredients and technologies to develop premium products that would positively affect the health and appearance of the skin. These products are priced relatively higher than regular skincare products, thereby placing them in the premium segment. Thus, the increased demand for premium skincare products is expected to drive the growth of the global cosmetics market during the forecast period.

Premium cosmetics market: Multichannel marketing is the key trend in the market
- The adoption of multichannel marketing strategies by vendors is one of the key premium cosmetics market trends that is expected to impact the industry positively in the forecast period.  Consumers are increasingly engaging in social media and blogs and are educating themselves about various topics. Hence, vendors are making use of such platforms to increase awareness and promote their products. Factors such as increasing internet penetration and a growing number of smartphone users has further enabled vendors to launch marketing strategies to engage customers and increase overall sales. This trend is expected to have a positive impact on the growth of the global premium cosmetics market during the forecast period.

The Accelerator is part of Deloitte's US$1 billion sustainability, climate and equity investment
NEW YORK, Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Key takeaways
- Deloitte's Low-Carbon Hub Accelerator is designed to bring together networks of supply-side and demand-side players to share costs and drive economies of scale, to help make a clean hydrogen economy in the U.S. a reality.
- Deloitte's 2022 study, "Low-Carbon Industrial Hubs: Driving Deep Decarbonization for Industry," found that surveyed companies who collaborate in hubs see up to a 95% reduction in the capital investment required when compared to individual companies deploying carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) by themselves.
- Deloitte is uniquely positioned to provide policy, tax and regulatory insight; strategic road-mapping and project management office support; business and operating model design services; hydrogen usage project design and execution; grant application and related incentives support; information technology and operational technology design, accounting and assurance services; and ecosystem facilitation.
- Deloitte's Low-Carbon Hub Accelerator is designed to be plug-compatible with virtually any combination of existing participants, including other professional services organizations.

Deloitte's new Low-Carbon Hub Accelerator offers unique approach to supporting hydrogen growth Why this matters
According to the International Energy Agency, hydrogen is one of the biggest innovation opportunities to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions to net zero by 2050, a widely accepted global target to avert the worst effects of climate change.
Although the push for decarbonization is gaining momentum, traditional strategies and methodologies are largely unable to address the majority of emissions for some sectors. Abatement solutions like clean hydrogen and CCUS remain cost-prohibitive for most companies to pursue on their own. Establishing low-carbon hubs in strategic geographical areas across the U.S. aims to further long-term decarbonization and help mitigate the effects of climate change.
Low-carbon hubs accelerate decarbonization for hard-to-abate sectors
"Hard-to-abate" sectors account for more than 30% of total global greenhouse gas emissions, and this number is only expected to grow as other industries make progress on their sustainability goals, according to Deloitte's May 2021 report, "Leading in a Low Carbon Future."
These sectors — heavy industry, such as chemicals, metals and mining; building materials and heavy road transport; as well as shipping and aviation — have some of the most challenging pathways toward emissions reduction, creating increased urgency to find new strategies to offset emissions.
According to the Deloitte study, "Low-Carbon Industrial Hubs: Driving Deep Decarbonization for Industry," low-carbon hubs can provide a cost-effective way for companies in hard-to-abate industries to accelerate their decarbonization efforts; demonstrate action on climate change to customers, investors and other stakeholders; and spur tipping points in low-carbon technology innovation. Deloitte found that surveyed companies that collaborate in hubs tend to have a more effective pathway for deep emission reductions.
Collaboration can help reduce emissions at a lower cost
Deloitte research identified hub models that can help maximize cost synergies, economies of scale and emissions reductions. Deloitte found that CCUS hubs with hydrogen, or "Industrial Hubs," are often the most comprehensive, combining CCUS infrastructure with hydrogen from fossil sources to create an ecosystem of multiple reinforcing solutions for downstream utilization or export.
The benefits of participating in hydrogen hubs are fairly clear: compared to individual companies that deploy CCUS by themselves, lower emission industrial hubs can help companies and industries reduce emissions by approximately 50%, at a cost that is 20% to 95% cheaper than when pursued alone.
Lower emissions industrial hubs can serve a variety of geographies across the U.S., each with their own unique industry configurations and addressable emissions profile. Deloitte also found that emissions reduction benefits driven by hubs extend to downstream customers who benefit from the lower emissions footprint of products supplied by the hub. Locally produced hydrogen can also help with energy security, while creating new business models and jobs.
The time is right in the U.S. market
Significant action at the federal level is accelerating the development of a viable hydrogen economy in the U.S. and positioning the country as a global low carbon hydrogen leader.
- In June 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy announced its intent to accept applications to award $8 billion in funding for the development of regional clean hydrogen hubs that demonstrate the production, processing, delivery, storage and end-use of clean hydrogen via its H2Hubs program.
- In September 2022, the DOE further elaborated that the initial $7 billion of this funding will be awarded to at least six to 10 regional clean hydrogen hubs through a competitive bidding process that will conclude by summer 2023, with awards ranging from $400 million to $1.25 billion.
- The formation of hydrogen hubs is expected to help drive towards the DOE's "earth shot" objective of bringing the cost of clean hydrogen production to $1 per kilogram within the next decade and contribute to achieving DOE's goals for H2@Scale, which provides an overarching vision for how clean hydrogen can enable energy pathways.
- In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 providing historic investments to combat climate change and create clean energy solutions, including an additional boost to the U.S. clean hydrogen economy through a new tax credit of up to 30% of eligible capital costs, collectively estimated at over $13.1 billion. The IRA also extends and enhances incentives for hydrogen fueling stations.

Services approach drives progress throughout the hydrogen economy
The Low-Carbon Hub Accelerator projects are part of Deloitte sustainability, climate, and equity a practice serving clients as they define a path to a more sustainable future. Building upon years of sustainability and climate client service, Deloitte is assembling one of the largest global networks of sustainability experience including an investment of US$1 billion in client-related services, data-driven research, and assets and capabilities. Globally, Deloitte is involved in multiple hubs, working with consortium leaders on feasibility studies, business cases, connecting supply and demand centers, and supporting acceleration.
Through Deloitte's Low-Carbon Hub Accelerator, companies can benefit from a unique approach to supporting hydrogen growth no matter where they are in the journey. Comprehensive, end-to-end services generally focus on strategic development, as well as the construction of hubs, technology implementations, and insight into the current policy and regulatory environment driving the hydrogen economy.
Deloitte services include:
- Strategy: Deloitte specialists evaluate and help prioritize the impact of trends and uncertainties in the market, make recommendations related to organizations' strategies and operating models, and shape public policy in support of hydrogen market development.
- Operations: Through the Low-Carbon Hub Accelerator, Deloitte can help execute on strategy by implementing and — where appropriate — operating the capabilities, processes, technologies and infrastructure to bring low-carbon hubs to life.
- Finance: Deloitte can provide support and recommendations on policy, accounting and tax, and also recommend ways to leverage the evolving capital market transition and U.S. government grants and incentives to increase sustainable investments and optimize cost and capital structures.
- Reporting: Deloitte can provide advice and recommendations related to ESG readiness and integrated reporting, including related governance and controls.

Key quote
"Over the past five years, we've seen a steady acceleration by companies in all sectors in their efforts to decarbonize the value chains in which they operate. Combined with new government funding and policies for developing low-carbon hubs, this momentum provides a rare catalyst to attract private investment and scale up quickly, particularly within hard-to-abate industries. While low-carbon hydrogen is quickly – and finally – showing itself to be one of the key, viable lynchpins to achieve bold societal climate goals, we might only get there if companies embrace a collaborative, cross-industry approach to accelerate the energy transition."

US171653AA64/ USP26064AA66) (the "Notes") issued by the Company (the "Offer") for an aggregate purchase price, excluding accrued and unpaid interest, if any, of up to U.S.$150 million, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the offer to purchase dated November 15, 2022 (the "Offer to Purchase"). We refer to the aggregate amount that Holders are entitled to receive for Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and accepted for purchase in the Offer, excluding Accrued Interest (as defined below), as the "Aggregate Purchase Price."
According to the information received from D.F. King & Co., Inc., the information agent for the Offer, as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time on November 29, 2022 (the "Early Tender Date"), the Company had received valid tenders of Notes (and not validly withdrawn) representing an aggregate principal amount equal to U.S.$201,381,000 of Notes, which represents an Aggregate Purchase Price of U.S.$142,980,510 pursuant to the terms of the Offer.
Accordingly, subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer as set forth in the Offer to Purchase, the Company has accepted for purchase the Notes tendered as of the Early Tender Date and expects that payment for all Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) at or prior to the Early Tender Date and accepted by the Company will be made on December 2, 2022 (the "Early Settlement Date"). Holders who validly tendered, and did not validly withdraw, their Notes on or prior to the Early Tender Date are eligible to receive the "Total Consideration" of U.S.$710.00 per U.S.$1,000 of principal amount of Notes tendered. The Total Consideration includes an "Early Tender Premium" of U.S.$50.00 per U.S.$1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered. On the Early Settlement Date, the Company will also pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes accepted for purchase from the last applicable interest payment date for the Notes up to, but excluding, the Early Settlement Date, together with additional amounts thereon, if any.
The obligation of the Company to accept for purchase, and to pay for, Notes validly tendered pursuant to the Offer is subject to, and conditioned upon, the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions as set forth in the Offer to Purchase, including the New Debt Condition, in the sole discretion of the Company.
The Offer will expire on 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on December 13, 2022 (the "Expiration Date").
Holders who validly tender their Notes after the Early Tender Date but on or prior to the Expiration Date will be eligible to receive the "Tender Consideration" of U.S.$660.00 per U.S.$1,000 of principal amount of Notes tendered, which is equal to the Total Consideration less the Early Tender Premium.  The "Final Settlement Date" is the date that we settle all Notes not previously settled on the Early Settlement Date, if any, and we expect such date to be promptly following the Expiration Date.

Test Preparation Market in the US: The increasing use of analytical tools in test preparations   drives the growth
- The increasing use of analytical tools in test preparations is one of the key drivers supporting the test preparation market growth in the US.  The analytical tools provide not only effective and efficient test preparation modules but also offer various insights that can be used by teachers, trainers, as well as students to identify their progress by means of reporting tools, thereby optimizing the entire learning process. For instance, Kaplan, through its corporate partnership programs, provides various Kaplan Partner Solutions (KPS) consisting of test preparation programs that offer performance analysis tools. These performance-tracking tools help educators identify program trends and any outstanding matriculation and retention issues associated with individual students. Other factors such as the growth of the test prep market in India and other countries will drive the test preparation market growth during the forecast period.

Test Preparation Market in the US: Technological advances in test preparation services are the key trend in the market
- Technological advances in test preparation services are one of the key trends in the market.  The rising tech-savvy population and rising adoption of tablets, mobile phones, and other mobile devices have led to an increased demand for the technologically advanced mode of delivery, as well as innovative test preparation through the incorporation of various visual technologies. Moreover, educators are emphasizing the use of visual technologies such as AR and VR and other technologies such as virtual schools to impart education to students. For instance, MITAR games developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Teacher Education Program and The Education Arcade blend real-life locations with virtual individuals and scenarios to enhance the learning skills of the student. Hence, these factors fuel the growth of the test preparation market in the US.

Full text: FULLERTON, Calif., Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --  ODK Media, Inc. , an independent international media group, debuted a major UX (user experience) and UI (user interface) overhaul for its largest streaming service, OnDemandKorea , on the company's 11th anniversary. The site and app redesign reinforces ODK Media, Inc's brand identity and delivers a consistent user experience across all devices: web, mobile app and CTV. The significant front-end changes are supported by the company's proprietary back-end platform, ODX, which enables features including enhanced content discovery, FAST (24/7 live and curated channels), a streamlined VOD experience, and personalization.
"Changing the face familiar to our users for 11 years was not an easy decision," said Peter Park, CPO of ODK Media, Inc.

"Changing the face familiar to our users for 11 years was not an easy decision," said Peter Park, CPO of ODK Media, Inc., who led this cross-platform innovation project. "However, we are assured of what users value the most in consuming content, generating insight from the user's behavioral data and customer communications. We focused on simplicity to improve the user experience on the front-end while creating the technology infrastructure to support all the features that drive up user engagement. Our back-end platform, ODX, allows us to revolutionize our services with scale and flexibility, adapting to the needs of both our users and our brand partners."
ODX, ODK Media, Inc.'s proprietary unified platform, supports linear channels and VOD technology for the several international streaming services owned and operated by ODK Media, Inc. by managing each services' CMS (Content Management System), search and recommendation engine, data warehousing,  and monetization–whether through advertising, subscription, or both.

With its strategic service line-up of international OTT streaming platforms, digital magazines, e-commerce platforms, metadata production, and content distribution platform, ODK Media, Inc. has a holistic view of user behavior and intentions, while providing quality content and service.

Newly enhanced QKD product will strengthen security against cyber attacks
CANBERRA, Australia and SAN JOSE, Calif., Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- QuintessenceLabs, a leader in the quantum cybersecurity industry, announced today at Quantum World Congress that its  qOptica ™  Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) solution offers enhanced key enabling technology to help improve security against harmful cyber-attacks such as "harvest now, decrypt later" (HNDL) threats where proprietary data is stolen now with the intent of decrypting it later with quantum technology. The second generation of qOptica QKD provides superior protection, while securely delivering key material that is immune to brute force and algorithmic attacks by conventional or quantum computers.
QuintessenceLabs' qOptica QKD uses Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CV-QKD) to achieve secure key distribution. It is a point-to-point system protocol that uses specialized hardware to share secret keys over an optical link. Secrecy of the keys is guaranteed by the laws of quantum physics, as the system protects information against eavesdroppers and only outputs keys when it can exploit an information advantage.
While CV-QKD is a newer technology than Discrete Variable Quantum Key Distribution (DV-QKD), it now has similar performance levels as its predecessor, while also offering a significantly superior path forward in terms of cost and performance. CV-QKD was proven to be information-theoretically secure in 2009, putting it on par with DV-QKD in terms of security.
"Many companies today think that encrypting data with current technology will offer robust protection, but that is not the case. Organizations must get ahead of HNDL attacks by implementing CV-QKD technology today to ensure they can deliver high-rate secure key exchange, specifically over metropolitan distances and passive optical fiber infrastructure as used in existing communications networks," said QuintessenceLabs CRO Silvio Pappalardo. "QuintessenceLabs' qOptica quantum key distribution technology delivers a superior path forward in terms of cost and performance , which are two key factors as we move our industry forward during an important time for quantum technology and security in general."
Quantum World Congress is the first-ever gathering of its kind, connecting the world's quantum ecosystem of innovators, researchers, and technology developers, with legislators and industry experts, to accelerate the value of the growing quantum industry. The three-day event takes place from November 29 through December 1 in Washington, D.C. and offers unique cross-sector perspectives where people will meet to discuss the latest in trends in quantum.
For more information on qOptica quantum key distribution visit QuintessenceLabs at booth #110.

Full text: New innovations enable companies to reach and respond to customers effectively, in their moment of need, from top channels like Google and Facebook
DETROIT, Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Uberall, a global provider of hybrid customer experience (CX) solutions, today announced a series of new innovations to help businesses offer customers more convenient ways to find, explore, book, and buy the products and services they want. One of the more exciting features introduced to the Uberall CoreX platform is Messages, a complete messaging solution that helps multi-location businesses shorten their customer's path to purchase via live agents and lifelike local AI chatbots.
"While many companies understand the importance of customer convenience, they often consider it a daunting proposition to give customers the ability to message them - especially when they run many locations," says Florian Hübner, Uberall CEO and founder. "However, research clearly shows that consumers prefer to message businesses about products and services, and are even prepared to pay more for convenience. We built Messages to make it incredibly easy and scalable for businesses to engage with and convert local customers on the messaging platforms they use."
New Tool Enhancements Include:
Uberall Messages
Messaging is rapidly growing as one of the fastest and most convenient ways for customers to get what they need or want. In fact, 75% of consumers say they prefer to engage with brands via messaging, instead of traditional channels. Yet 72% of businesses report they don't offer chat on their Google Business profile, most likely due to the difficulty of scaling messaging across multiple locations and channels.
Uberall Messages helps businesses activate messaging channels for each location with confidence and speed, equipping them with a single interface where they can engage directly with customers on popular messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger and Google. Businesses can choose to respond to messages manually, or activate conversational AI chatbots that draw on their location's data profiles to provide lifelike answers and interactions 24/7. This means customers now have a quick and easy way to check opening hours or product availability, reserve a table or service, and much more.
"Uberall Messages has been a game changer for us. It enabled us to implement conversational commerce with ease and confidence, while ensuring we reply to all customer inquiries. We've been able to automate a large number of responses, particularly appointment requests, which represent 70% of the messages we receive," says Letizia Julie, Digital Marketing Project Manager at DEKRA. "Beyond improvements in our customer relationship management processes, this tool allows us to free up time for our field teams, who juggle technical controls and phone bookings."
Uberall Review Generation
Reviews play a key role in influencing purchasing decisions, with 70% of consumers saying they read between one and six online reviews before making a purchase. Moreover, a survey conducted by Uberall showed a star rating increase of just 0.1 stars can lead to a 25% improvement in conversion rates.
Uberall Review Generation allows businesses to get more reviews by inviting customers to share their experiences online. Brands can safely and scalably invite customers via email or text using customizable templates and a link to leave a review for the specific location they visited. Combined with responding to customer reviews, generating more reviews helps businesses boost trust and gain deeper insights across every location. Review Generation is the latest addition to Uberall's end-to-end review management suite that allows businesses to not only encourage more reviews, but to efficiently monitor and respond to them, as well as analyze sentiment.
"Reviews play a key role in our customer experience strategy, so being able to easily generate reviews at scale is key," adds Letizia. "More positive reviews help to rank higher in searches, attract more customers and build their trust in the brand. I see this product as a must-have for every business wanting to improve their online visibility and customer engagement."
Uberall Media Manager and Premium Photos
Relevant, high-quality images are becoming increasingly central to how consumers discover, find, and engage with products and businesses. In fact, businesses with photos on their Google Listings receive 42% more requests for directions. However, creating, organizing, and publishing search engine-optimized photos might not be feasible for businesses with tens or hundreds of locations.
Uberall Premium Photos streamlines the process of publishing local photos to every location's online business profile, with an end-to-end service that includes professionally shot photos optimized for search and discovery. In addition, Uberall Media Manager makes it easy for businesses to centrally organize local photos and videos and take control over how their locations look on Google, Apple Maps, Facebook, and other directories. An early Uberall customer case study shows how optimized photos help search engines assess the relevance of a business, improving visibility: The customer saw a 60% month-over-month improvement in rank for 'breakfast' and 'breakfast sandwich' after publishing related photos.
Local Inventory
Google research shows global searches for "in-stock" have grown more than 700% year over year and 6 in 10 internet users check whether a product is available in a local store before visiting.
Uberall's groundbreaking new Local Inventory solution allows retailers to dynamically publish and promote products they have in stock at their local stores online, in places such as Google Search and their website. This innovation helps them get discovered and drive footfall in those 'want it now' moments, or get their local goods in front of customers who are currently 'just browsing'.

Full text: VIENNA, Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Since 2020, grommunio, an Austrian software manufacturer has been offering exactly what data protectionists and security experts have been demanding for years: A replacement for Microsoft Exchange that works with standard programs and can be set up in infrastructures of any size.
The "drop-in" replacement for Exchange supports all software protocols used by Microsoft's server, works in the usual way and without changes to clients with Outlook, Android, iPhone and Linux clients and includes a modern web interface including administration interface.
At the same time, the innovative open source architecture makes grommunio more secure, efficient, transparent and traceable than competitors, while also being significantly faster and more resource-efficient. grommunio runs on  Raspberry Pi up to mainframes.
However, grommunio offers not only email, calendar, tasks, office and contacts, but also chat, video conferencing and file synchronization, as it relies on proven enterprise open source components.
The attractive solutions for administrators are due to a powerful portal for administration of grommunio servers. Warnings about impending bottlenecks ("predictive monitoring") and a self-service portal for users as well as an installation wizard with data transfer from existing systems are also included.
grommunio works so smoothly as a replacement for Microsoft Exchange environments of any size, because the software directly accesses the functions that Exchange itself provides. In addition to MAPI/HTTP, grommunio offers all common open standards, which ensures openness, transparency, security and stability - and simplifies any migration to grommunio: IMAP, POP3, SMTP, EAS, CalDAV and CardDAV are the most prominent examples.
From the website of the manufacturer https://grommunio.com/  a free community version and detailed information is available.

Full text: Having worked in the startup industry for over ten years, this founder has seen enough waste in early stage-startups and wants to help. Savee helps business leaders coordinate, track, and manage their SaaS vendors in one unified platform.
HOUSTON, Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Savee, a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Management Platform, billed as a VendorOS for scaling startups, officially launched today.
Founded and headquartered in Houston, TX, Savee's Founder and President, Jason Howie, draws upon his years of experience in software-as-a-service marketing and leadership to address an often overlooked problem in many early-growth companies, SaaS Sprawl. SaaS Sprawl occurs when companies lack coordination and accountability with their vendors. This leads to duplicative services, lapsing contracts, increased administration time, and unnecessary spending.
"We created Savee because we saw a need for a comprehensive SaaS management solution for small companies," said Jason Howie, President and Founder. "With Savee, companies can focus on building their businesses rather than chasing down old contracts and points of contact."
The problem is real for businesses; in a survey of over 350 business leaders, Savee saw that 16% had no vendor management process, and 46% used spreadsheets and shared documents to manage their SaaS contracts.
David Dulany, Founder and CEO of Tenbound, a growing Sales Development Advisory group, put some color to the pain, "We had two contracts auto-renew without anyone telling us until after the fact. The vendors wouldn't let me out, and now we have to pay a total of $13k for two things that nobody wants or uses." David adds, "We're a bootstrapped organization; that money could be spent elsewhere and had a real impact on our programs."
Available today and now on Product Hunt, Savee offers free and paid options to startups looking for a solution to manage their SaaS products. Business leaders can track their subscriptions, vendors, and more all in one centralized platform.
Savee:
Savee is a startup-friendly platform that helps businesses buy and manage vendor contracts. It identifies vendor overlaps and potential compliance issues while uncovering cost savings and managing the approval and renewal processes. This helps savvy business leaders scale rapidly and efficiently. https://besavee.com

Full text: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- TIANGEN, a leading brand in the field of nucleic acid purification in China, has announced its participation in the Cell Bio 2022, the joint meeting of the American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) and European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO), from December 4 to 6, in Washington, DC, where it will bring a groundbreaking automated solution at Booth 621.
The featured product that will be showcased at Booth 621 is the TGuide S16 Nucleic Acid Extractor. It could be a stunning product for most molecular biologists and cell biologists to learn about. "Researchers spend lots of their time on the repetitive hands-on experiment, while there hasn't been an optimal automated nucleic acid extraction solution in the global life science market. Automated extractors used mainly to serve industry. But now it's time for a change." said Kefei Sun, the GM of TIANGEN, "TIANGEN develops the TGuide S16, that is groundbreaking to this field".
Apparently, the TGuide S16 is much smaller than all other extractors you may have ever seen. It processes up to 16 samples for a run and occupies less space than a piece of A4 paper. The design of the size, throughput and very importantly, the supporting reagent in prefilled format is all tailored for scientists to have the easy-to-use work experience.
Although small in size, the TGuide S16, as the 5 th generation of TIANGEN's TGuide S series extractors, adopts the upgraded magnetic bead-based extraction technique and series of formulas targeting all common samples in academic laboratories. The 10-year experience in automated purification should empower the TGuide S16 to produce reliable results to research users study all different sample types. Scientists may say farewell to the tedious manual DNA/RNA/plasmid/gel/PCR product purification protocols and walk into the new automated era.
TIANGEN invites all interested scientists to apply for their newly launched Star Product Reviewer Recruitment Program, where they provide 1 on 1 product presentation and technical support, customized free trial opportunities, and exquisite gift packages. "We are very looking forward to meeting molecular biologists and cell biologists at Cell Bio 2022," said Kefei Sun, "Let the TGuide S16 bail the scientists out from tons of manual experiments and head for super productivity".

ROSELAND, N.J., Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Private sector employment increased by 127,000 jobs in November and annual pay was up 7.6 percent year-over-year, according to the November ADP ® National Employment Report™ produced by the ADP Research Institute ® in collaboration with the Stanford Digital Economy Lab ("Stanford Lab").
The jobs report and pay insights use ADP's fine-grained anonymized and aggregated payroll data of over 25 million U.S. employees to provide a representative picture of the labor market. The report details the current month's total private employment change, and weekly job data from the previous month. ADP's pay measure uniquely captures the earnings of a cohort of almost 10 million employees over a 12-month period.
"Turning points can be hard to capture in the labor market, but our data suggest that Federal Reserve tightening is having an impact on job creation and pay gains," said Nela Richardson, chief economist, ADP. "In addition, companies are no longer in hyper-replacement mode. Fewer people are quitting and the post-pandemic recovery is stabilizing."

- In partnership with The Mom Project, the Chicago-based program will offer moms who have taken a career pause a smooth path to return to the workforce
- The Mom Project is a leading digital talent marketplace for moms to discover their economic potential through its robust suite of hiring, education and retention solutions
- For each BMO hire, The Mom Project will provide a technical scholarship through RISE, its not-for-profit, equity-focused upskilling arm designed to empower moms and women of color with access to greater career opportunities in emergent industries

CHICAGO, Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - BMO today announced the launch of its Returnship Program, a collaboration with The Mom Project, to provide moms who have a gap in their career or have left the workforce a smooth path to return without having to start over. The program will focus on recruiting, training, and upskilling moms and women of color for technology roles with paid, full-time employment while providing mentorship and support each step of the way.
"BMO's commitment to building a society with Zero Barriers to Inclusion is one of the defining hallmarks of our culture," said Atul Verma, Chief Information Officer, U.S. Personal and Business Banking at BMO. "As a leader in our communities, we strive to make pathways to inclusion a priority. Our new program for returnship in technology roles is an innovative way to help build such a pathway to attract talent for a diverse organization."
Since the start of the pandemic, a staggering 2 million women exited the workforce in the U.S., according to the National Women's Law Center, with moms of color being hit particularly hard by job loss. By partnering with The Mom Project to continue the bank's efforts to break down barriers faced by women and people of color, Returnship hires will receive formal training and development to accelerate time to productivity, catch up on industry advancements, and receive mentorship to set employees up for success.
"We are thrilled to partner with The Mom Project on BMO's Returnship Program to support women who have selflessly put their careers on hold and smoothly guide them back into careers in banking and technology," said Mary Kay Kaminski, Managing Director for U.S. Personal and Business Banking at BMO. "This program is a bold step to help women regain momentum in their careers and we look forward to welcoming and supporting these talented women as they reenter the workforce."
"Partnering with BMO to launch their Returnship Program will not only create more opportunities for moms and women of color in financial services and technology, but it can also build new economic pathways that may not have been accessible before," said Allison Robinson, CEO, The Mom Project. "We see firsthand how our RISE graduates have significantly benefited from the ability to upskill and pivot careers and industries, proving the economic and social value these programs deliver to an underserved but very talented group of women."
BMO's U.S. Personal and Business Banking Technology team has already began hiring for FTE developer roles and the program's unique model allows the bank to fill positions as often as needed over a 12-month period. For each BMO hire, The Mom Project will provide a technical scholarship through RISE, its not for profit, equity-focused upskilling arm, designed to empower moms and women of color with access to greater career opportunities in emergent industries.
BMO is committed to supporting the advancement of women both within the bank and beyond, including through: 
- $1.2 million in funding to SheEO – a not-for-profit company which offers financial support to businesses led by women and non-binary people. BMO's financial commitment allowed SheEO to fund all 2021 venture applicant companies.
- BMO Empower – a series of long-term commitments to advance inclusive economic recovery in the United States, pledging $5 billion over the next five years to address key barriers faced by minority businesses, communities and families.
- WMNfintech program – a collaboration between BMO and 1871, designed for women-led fintech start-ups that create services or solutions for the financial sector, offer insights and advice to customers, or help identify customer needs. The program provides women founders with curriculum and guidance from industry experts and an opportunity to pitch venture capital investors for feedback, mentoring, continued connections, and potential for funding.
- BMO Celebrating Women Grant Program – a partnership with Deloitte, BMO pledges $80,000 in grants each year to support the high-level growth plans of eight women-owned businesses across the United States.
- Set new diversity goals for senior leader and executive roles through its Zero Barriers to Inclusion 2025 strategy, including maintaining its leadership in gender diversity with at least 40 percent of senior leadership roles filled by employees who identify as women.

Developing and Demonstrating VR of Infectious Disease Education in Collaboration with Juntendo University
Approximately 15% of All Deaths in Thailand Are Caused by Infectious Diseases
TOKYO, Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Jolly Good Inc. (Chuo-ku, Tokyo, CEO: Kensuke Joji, hereinafter referred to as "Jolly Good"), in collaboration with Juntendo University (Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, President: Hajime Arai), will commence a demonstration project for the introduction of medical education VR for the purpose of developing medical human resources through the use of VR at Royal Mahidol University (Bangkok, Thailand, President: Prof. Banchong Mahaisavariya, hereinafter referred to as "Mahidol University") and throughout Thailand. This is the first time that Japanese medical VR has been officially introduced into an overseas university.
In this project, Jolly Good will provide Mahidol University with VR teaching material production facilities and VR experience equipment to create an environment that enables the self-production of VR teaching materials for infectious disease treatment education at the university. The technology will be introduced in four departments: the Faculty of Tropical Medicine at Mahidol University, the School of Nursing and the Faculty of Medicine at Ramathibodi Hospital, and the Educational Simulation Center at Chakri Naruebodindra Medical Institute. The VR educational materials will be used in demonstration classes at Mahidol University to verify their effectiveness, after which they will be used to conduct medical education using VR at regional hospitals in Thailand.
This project is also partially supported by Juntendo University's IT-based Human Resource Development Project for Infectious Diseases and Community Medicine in Thailand and Southeast Asia (*) , a project adopted by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW).
(*See more information about the adopted project: https://kyokuhp.ncgm.go.jp/activity/open/r4pdf/10_Juntendo_University.pdf)
- Approximately 15% of all deaths in Thailand are caused by infectious diseases. Education on infectious disease treatment is required in medical practice in Thailand.

According to a survey by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Thailand has the highest percentage of deaths from infectious diseases among countries in Asia, revealing that its healthcare system for infectious diseases is lagging behind.
In Thailand, 0.9 in 1,000 people are doctors, which indicates a shortage of doctors in Thailand compared to the other countries. In addition, doctors in Thailand are required to engage in community medical care for three years after graduation, but they do not receive sufficient training or education for infectious diseases, and there is a need for a system to develop human resources who can respond to various infectious diseases including COVID-19, and provide medical care in the community.
- Medium- and long-term vision for the introduction and demonstration project

In the first year, the medical VR program will be completed at Mahidol University. In subsequent years, the project will aim to enhance their knowledge and experience at an early stage and improve the quality of medical care including dealing with health crises in community medicine, thereby providing education using VR to the medical students, residents, and physicians involved in community medicine along the Thai border.
Year 1: Build a self-production environment for VR teaching materials at Mahidol University, complete the education program, and commence operation at the university.
Year 2: Provide VR educational materials to regional hospitals in Thailand that collaborate with Mahidol University, and conduct operational deployment of the materials throughout Thailand.
Year 3 and beyond: Provide VR teaching materials to Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries.
- Joint International Tropical Medicine Meeting "JITMM2022" Bilateral Medical VR Seminar Information

We will hold a bilateral medical VR seminar connecting Japan and Thailand at Joint International Tropical Medicine Meeting "JITMM2022" in Thailand. In this seminar, professors from Mahidol University will give a remote VR lecture to medical students of Juntendo University in Japan by utilizing the educational VR of Infectious Disease Education produced at Mahidol University.
＜Seminar Information＞
Theme: Virtual Reality in Medical Education
Date and time (ICT): Monday, December 7th 10:30am – 12:00 pm
Place: Montiel Hotel Surawong Room C, Bangkok, Thailand
Speakers :
Dr. Aongart Mahittikorn, Associate Professor, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University (Chairperson)
Dr. Rapeepan Prasertbun, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University
Dr. Toshio Naito, Professor, Faculty of Medical Science, Juntendo University (Chairperson)
Dr. Hirotake Mori, Associate Professor, Faculty of Medical Science, Juntendo University
- Comments made by those involved in the project


We have great expectations in VR-medical education. After the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand, we faced difficulties teaching infectious diseases to students and medical staff. We have been seeking new technologies to provide high-quality medical education, and now Thailand educators are more concerned about VR. In this project, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, plans to make high-quality VR contents in the Tropical Medicine field.

In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Juntendo University has worked to develop medical human resources for infectious diseases while in-person classes and bedside practice have been restricted. Medical education using VR is very realistic, providing an experience similar to actual medical treatment. It can also be used for education in remote areas and community medicine. With the cooperation of Jolly Good, Mahidol University in Thailand will begin to conduct medical education using VR. We hope that this project will be a springboard for the provision of standard medical education transcending national borders to the world in the future.

Full text: Multipurpose facility migrates to the enterprise accounting solution PVNG by Aptech due to ease of use and exceptional customer service
PITTSBURGH, Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- For the Hilton Chicago and Oak Brook Hills Resort & Conference Center, the simplicity and accessibility of its enterprise accounting solution is key to managing a successful and streamlined financial operation. The bleisure destination is running its general ledger, accounts payable, statistics, financials, and bank reconciliation processes on PVNG by Aptech. Users say the ability to jump between financials from one property to the next, train staff quickly on the system, and use only one platform for multi-property accounting is a game changer.
Director of Finance Maridel Canaday said the dual facility has been running on Aptech for several years. When they learned that Aptech's legacy accounting application, Profitvue, was being phased out, migrating to PVNG was a logical decision due not only to the system's flexibility and browser navigation, but because Aptech's customer service and support has historically been superb, and it is something Canaday said she and her team have come to depend on.
"Aptech's customer service has always been excellent," Canaday said. "The staff is very helpful and quick to respond. Good support is hard to find, and it's not something we wanted to walk away from. Once we saw how easy it would be to work within PVNG – our management team can log in and run reports from anywhere and we can import data from the PMS, Payroll, POS, and export GL transactions to Excel with ease – the decision to stay with Aptech was a breeze."
With the switch to PVNG complete, Canaday said the company is now looking to upgrade its budgeting process to Aptech's Targetvue solution. This tool will give the Hilton Chicago and Oak Brook Hills Resort & Conference Center the ability to build flexible driver-based budgets and forecasts, manage the planning process from a central location, and set goals for every area of their organization.
"Aptech has been developing web-based, customizable, financial-management software for more than 50 years, and part of our success stems from building long-term relationships with our valued customers," said Cam Troutman, Aptech Vice President. "The Hilton Chicago and Oak Brook Hills Resort & Conference Center has learned over the years that Aptech is here for them, no matter what they need – be it a customized report or adding an entire new financial platform. We are delighted that they opted to stay a part of the Aptech family and we look forward to expanding our relationship and introducing new solutions in the future."

Full text: HOUSTON, Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - Enbridge Inc. (Enbridge) (TSX: ENB) (NYSE: ENB) and Oxy Low Carbon Ventures (OLCV), a subsidiary of Occidental (NYSE: OXY), today announced that the parties intend to work towards jointly developing a carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration hub in the Corpus Christi area of the Texas Gulf Coast. Enbridge and OLCV signed a letter of intent to explore this joint project, which would provide a complete CO2 solution for area emitters through the development of a pipeline transportation system and sequestration facility.
Enbridge and OLCV would leverage each company's strengths to advance the development of a sequestration hub and associated transportation infrastructure. Enbridge would develop, construct, and operate the pipeline facilities and OLCV would develop, construct, and operate the sequestration facilities. The hub is expected to provide CO2 solutions for Enbridge's proposed facilities as well as other point source emitters in the Corpus Christi area.
Enbridge and OLCV would jointly market the CO2 pipeline transportation and sequestration services to other third-party CO2 point source emitters in the Ingleside and Corpus Christi areas.
"We are excited to be partnering with OLCV to explore developing a large-scale CO2 transport and sequestration hub in the Corpus Christi area," said Colin Gruending, Enbridge Executive Vice President and President, Liquids Pipelines. "This is a unique opportunity for two organizations to pair complementary skill sets in a way that decarbonizes our own facilities and provides a platform for our industrial neighbors who are also seeking to reduce their emissions."
"We look forward to working with Enbridge as we advance our plans to develop sequestration hubs that will provide a practical decarbonization solution for industrial emitters," said Jeff Alvarez, President and General Manager, Sequestration, Oxy Low Carbon Ventures. "This collaboration will help accelerate the path to net zero not only for ourselves, but for other organizations who are exploring end-to-end solutions to capture, transport and permanently store CO2."
Forward-Looking Information—Enbridge Forward-looking information, or forward-looking statements, have been included in this news release to provide information about Enbridge Inc. ("Enbridge" or the "Company") and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including management's assessment of Enbridge and its subsidiaries' future plans and operations. This information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as ''anticipate'', ''expect'', ''project'', ''estimate'', ''forecast'', ''plan'', ''intend'', ''target'', ''believe'', "likely" and similar words suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook. Forward-looking information or statements in this news release include statements with respect to the proposed CO2 pipeline transportation system and sequestration facility in the Corpus Christi, TX area, including the characteristics and benefits thereof and the anticipated supply and customer arrangements for the project.
Although Enbridge believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable based on the information available on the date such statements are made and processes used to prepare the information, such statements are not guarantees of future performance and readers are cautioned against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements. By their nature, these statements involve a variety of assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results, levels of activity and achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Assumptions regarding the expected supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, renewable energy and other commodities, and the prices of these commodities, are material to and underlie all forward-looking statements, as they may impact current and future levels of demand for the Company's services. Similarly, energy transition, including the drivers and pace thereof, exchange rates, inflation and interest rates impact the economies and business environments in which the Company operates and may impact levels of demand for the Company's services and cost of inputs, and are therefore inherent in all forward-looking statements. Due to the interdependencies and correlation of these macroeconomic factors, the impact of any one assumption on a forward-looking statement cannot be determined with certainty. The most relevant assumptions associated with forward-looking statements on announced projects and projects under construction, including estimated in-service dates and the realization of anticipated benefits, include the following: the impact of litigation and government, regulatory and stakeholder actions and approvals on construction and in-service schedules; the availability and price of labour and construction materials; the effects of inflation and foreign exchange rates on labour and material costs; the effects of interest rates on borrowing costs; technology-related matters; the impact of weather; and   expectations about our partners' ability to complete and finance proposed projects.
Enbridge's forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those risks and uncertainties discussed in this news release and in the Company's other filings with Canadian and United States securities regulators. The impact of any one risk, uncertainty or factor on a particular forward-looking statement is not determinable with certainty as these are interdependent and Enbridge's future course of action depends on management's assessment of all information available at the relevant time. Except to the extent required by applicable law, Enbridge assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements made in this news release or otherwise, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All subsequent forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, attributable to Enbridge or persons acting on the Company's behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements.
Forward-Looking Information—Occidental This news release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including those relating to Occidental's strategy, its impact on the environment, the anticipated project's benefits and related impact on carbon emissions, and OLCV's and its subsidiaries' plans to build, acquire and operate sequestration hubs as part of Occidental's net-zero strategy. These statements are based on Occidental's current expectations, beliefs, plans, estimates and forecasts. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements for purposes of federal and state securities laws. Words, and variations of words, such as "anticipate," "will," "would," "may," "expect," "plan," "develop," "explore" or similar expressions that convey the prospective nature of events or outcomes are generally indicative of forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this news release. Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update, modify, or withdraw any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
These statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and risks and uncertainties, including those that are beyond Occidental's control. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements include Occidental's and OLCV's ability to access necessary technology, to develop and employ existing or new technology on a commercial scale, to acquire requisite pore space, to access capital, to collaborate with partners, third parties and customers and to receive approvals from regulatory bodies, as well as market conditions, geopolitical events and scientific developments. Additional factors that may affect OLCV's ability to develop, construct and operate sequestration hubs can be found in Occidental's public disclosure and its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which may be accessed at Occidental's website at oxy.com or the SEC's website at sec.gov.

Full text: Keta Kosman, Publisher, Madison's Lumber Reporter, est. 1952, Vancouver, BC, Canada, www.madisonsreport.com, 604 319-2266
VANCOUVER, BC, Nov. 30, 2022 /CNW/ - Sales of new homes in the US have bumped up and down for the second half of this year and recovered upward once again in October. While it is true that a slow-down is apparent in both construction and home buying activity, it is important to note that new building activity year-to-date remains almost even compared to January - October of 2021.
"The weekly Madison's Lumber prices are an excellent leading indicator of the monthly US housing starts and new home sales data." Total housing starts in the US for October 2022 fell -4.2% to 1.425 million units compared to the 1.488 million units reported for September, and were down -8.8% from the October 2021 rate of 1.563 million. Data for September 2022 was revised sharply higher, from the previously reported 1.439 million units.
After popping up in September, building permits in October dropped by -2.4%, to 1.526 million units from 1.564 million. This is -10.1% below the October 2021 rate of 1.698 million. During the first ten months of this year building permits were down only slightly compared to the same period in 2021. 
It is interesting to note that total permits in August were 1.542 million units, just +7.6% above starts for October. As there is usually a two-month lag between a building permit and a housing start, this data indicates a good momentum for ongoing construction activity.
Combined, there was a very high 1.722 million units under construction, 794,000 of those single-family homes.  This is well above the historical record-high of 1.628 million units that were under construction in 1973. These will eventually become starts and help to underpin residential construction.
Benchmark Softwood Lumber Prices Nov & US Housing Starts Oct: 2022
October starts of single-family housing, the largest share of the market and construction method which uses the most wood, were down by -6.1% to a rate of 855,000 units. Single-family authorizations were at 839,000 units, which is -3.6% below the September figure of 870,000 units. Building permits are generally submitted two months before the home building is begun, so this data is as indicator of December construction activity.
Shrewd investors  know that construction framing softwood lumber prices are a good leading indicator for US housing activity, including home building and home sales.   Don't miss out, get lumber price data updates directly to your desktop every Friday morning .
Madison's Benchmark Top-Six Softwood Lumber and Panel Prices:
Monthly Averages
Looking at lumber prices, after several weeks of staying flat, in the week ending November 25, 2022 the price of WSPF 2x4 #2&Btr KD (RL) was US$475 mfbm, said forest products industry price guide newsletter Madison's Lumber Reporter . This is down by -$15, or -3%, from the previous week when it was US$490 mfbm, and is up by +$13, or +3%, from one month ago when it was US$463 mfbm.
STAY AHEAD  of US housing price data by getting access to softwood lumber prices. Released every Friday for that week, since 1952 Madison's Lumber Prices is used by the forest products industry as a price guide for North American construction framing dimension softwood lumber.

* Madison's Lumber Prices , weekly, are a good forecast indicator of US home builder's current lumber buying activity ——> DETAILS
The U.S. Census Bureau and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development released November 23 new home sales and house price data. New home sales comprise 10% of real estate activity and are considered a leading housing market indicator as they are recorded when contracts are signed.
Bumping up and down in recent months, sales of new US single-family homes actually increased in October. There were 632,000 new single-family homes sold last month, which is up +7.5% from the downwardly revised September rate of 588,000 and is a -5.8% drop compared to October 2021 when it was 671,000.
Only 15,000 new homes sold last month were below US$400,000.
At the sales pace in September it would take 8.9 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 9.4 months in September.
"The median and average new home price delivered was sharply higher in October, suggesting the high-end consumer has been able to withstand the increase in mortgage payments," said economists at Contingent Macro. 
There were 470,000 new homes on the market at the end of last month, up from 463,000 units in September. Houses under construction made up 63% of the inventory, with homes yet to be started accounting for 24%.
Completed houses accounted for 13% of the inventory, well below a long-term average of 27%.
Benchmark Softwood Lumber Prices Nov & US NEW Home Sales Oct: 2022
The median sales price just keeps rising, this time up by +4.5%, to US$493,000, from US$470,600 in September. The October price is up +13% from one year ago, when it was $427,300. It is important to note that US new home prices rose sharply through all of 2021 and most of this year to date.
As for those lumber prices, compared to the same week last year when it was US$634 mfbm, the price of Western Spruce-Pine-Fir 2x4 #2&Btr KD (RL) for the week ending November 25, 2022 is down by -$170, or -26%. Compared to two years ago when it was US$620 mfbm, that week's price is down by -$145 or -23%.

Full text: OXFORD, United Kingdom, Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pathios Therapeutics Limited ("Pathios"), a biotech company focused on developing first-in-class therapies for cancer, today announced that Jeanmarie Guenot, Ph.D., has been appointed as a non-executive director to the company's board of directors. Dr. Guenot brings more than 30 years of experience in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, having worked in venture capital, as well as at public and private companies in roles spanning executive management, corporate development and research and development.
Dr. Guenot is currently the Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of Toreador Therapeutics, a preclinical stage company discovering and developing bispecific antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. In 2013, she founded Amphivena Therapeutics and served as the company's President and Chief Executive Officer through the end of 2019. During her time with Amphivena, Dr. Guenot oversaw the closing of a $62 million Series C financing, as well as the advancement of the company's lead therapeutic candidate, a novel T cell engager in clinical trials for acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, into Phase 1 clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumours. In 2015, while still leading Amphivena, she founded and became the President and Chief Executive Officer of Harpoon Therapeutics, a company developing half-life extended and conditionally-activated T cell engagement therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. In 2016, Dr. Guenot spun out Maverick Therapeutics from Harpoon and executed a strategic build-to-buy transaction with Takeda. This deal, which included a $125 million upfront option and R&D funding, and up to $525 million in option exercise and earnouts, was exercised in 2021.
"We are delighted to welcome Jeanmarie to Pathios to help us to deliver on the promise of targeting GPR65 as a critical innate immune checkpoint in solid tumours," said Stuart Hughes, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Pathios Therapeutics. "Her extensive experience in both corporate management and R&D leadership make her perfectly suited to support Pathios in the next phase of our mission to advance our GPR65 small-molecule inhibitors toward clinical development."
"I am honoured to join the board of Pathios Therapeutics and help support the ground-breaking science the company is advancing in the area of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The company has already compiled a compelling preclinical data package for its small molecule inhibitors of GPR65 that offers strong rationale for advancing the program into the clinic to address major unmet medical needs for cancer patients," said Dr. Guenot. "I look forward to working with the Pathios board and executive team at this pivotal time and am excited to contribute to the continued development of the company's first-in-class therapies."

Full text: BOSTON, Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- 
Opportunity Charging vs. Depot Charging
Charging electric buses has so far been done overnight in depots. However, if the daily operating range of the bus exceeds the real-world range that the driver is able to achieve, then local transit authorities are often left with two options. These two options are purchasing an electric bus with a bigger battery, which is more expensive or buying a secondary bus to replace its service while the first one is being charged. Both options are costlier compared to traditional diesel buses. Not to mention, charging an electric bus during the day at the depot can incur costly peak demand charges. The term 'opportunity charging' refers to charging an electric vehicle for short periods throughout the day instead of charging it in full all at once. In short, one can charge the battery whenever the opportunity arises.
Wireless inductive charging best provides its benefits when applied as an en-route charging system. Wireless charging hardware installed at one or both ends of a route, top-up the batteries for typically 5 to 10 minutes while the bus is waiting at the terminus before a new trip/round-trip starts. With an automated charging process like wireless charging, one can integrate the charging process into the usual mode of operation by installing chargers where the bus must stop anyway or by charging while driving (referred to as dynamic wireless charging). Wireless chargers can also be strategically installed at bus stops for graze charging while letting passengers on and off. The charging process seamlessly integrates into daily operations, allowing continuous service, optimum fleet availability, and high efficiency. The latest report from IDTechEx, 'Wireless Charging Market for Electric Vehicles 2023-2033: Technology, Players and Forecasts', covers the enabling componentry needed on both the ground and vehicle side.
Benefits to Battery Lifetime
Lithium-ion batteries degrade with use. Overnight or deep-cycle discharge damages batteries, and high charge rates degrade batteries because of the temperature created. Studies have also shown that topping off batteries during the day keeps from having to charge batteries from deeply depleted states, extending battery life. A shallow, frequent charging of the battery is known to be better for the battery life than deep, infrequent charging. Wireless charging with several installed ground pads allows the battery to be charged on a shallow, frequent charging scheme, keeping them at an optimum state of charge between 45 to 75% during operation. However, more ground pads will require a greater initial investment. IDTechEx research finds that 70% of the infrastructure value is in the ground assembly (GA) and that high-power wireless charging systems can cost upwards of US$50,000 for the GA alone.
Battery downsizing potential
While high-power wireless chargers may be expensive to install, they pay back their investment in various ways. An additional benefit of opportunity charging is that when buses return with a higher state of charge, costly peak demand charges at the depot are reduced. Secondly, wireless opportunity charging helps to reduce the battery capacity required significantly. Instead of driving around tons of batteries, the buses focus on transporting people. The wireless opportunity charging technology increases the profitability of an electric bus fleet because the more frequent but shorter charging cycles reduce the required battery capacity and improve its service life. As a result, electric bus fleet operators can buy cheaper buses with smaller batteries. The IDTechEx report includes an operational analysis of real-world case studies highlighting the cost savings achieved by some transit authorities. Considering the example of an all-electric BYD K9 bus (The K9 is its best-selling model), IDTechEx research found the potential of downsizing the battery by 138kWh (to about half the original weight) can lead to cost savings of about US$55,000 per bus.
Players and Deployment
Companies like WAVE, InductEV (formerly Momentum Dynamics), and IPT are involved in the wireless opportunity charging of buses. The IDTechEx report includes their full company profiles, benchmarking of their technology by power, efficiency, air gap, and vehicle pad weight levels, alongside providing detailed deployment data. Furthermore, companies like Electreon are included in the report - companies working with big OEMs to commercialize dynamic wireless charging. However, their deployment is expensive – IDTechEx research estimates an electric road system to cost about US$1.5 million per kilometer. Overall, wireless opportunity charging is a promising new technology that offers some major benefits to transit authorities. The IDTechEx report, 'Wireless Charging Market for Electric Vehicles 2023-2033: Technology, Players and Forecasts', provides a comprehensive analysis of this emerging charging technology which is set to support the adoption of electric buses globally.

Full text: STOCKHOLM, Nov. 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --
- 5G continues to scale faster than any previous mobile generation

- 5G mobile subscriptions expected to reach five billion by the end of 2028

- Fixed Wireless Access forecast increased and now estimated to top 300 million connections within six years

Global 5G subscriptions remain on track to top one billion by the end of this year, and five billion by the end of 2028, despite current and developing economic challenges in many parts of the world. The November 2022 edition of the Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) Mobility Report also forecasts global fixed wireless access (FWA) connections to grow faster than previously expected.
FWA - the wireless alternative to wireline broadband connectivity for homes and businesses - is one of the major early 5G use cases, particularly in regions with unserved or underserved broadband markets.
Driven in part by accelerated FWA plans in India, and expected growth in other emerging markets, FWA is forecast to grow at 19 percent year-on-year through 2022-28, and top 300 million connections by the end of 2028.
More than three-quarters of communications service providers (CSPs) surveyed in more than 100 countries currently offer FWA services. Almost one-third of CSPs are offering FWA over 5G, compared to one-fifth a year ago. Almost 40 percent of the new 5G FWA launches in the past 12 months have been in emerging markets
On 5G itself, about 110 million subscriptions were added globally between July-September 2022, bringing the total to about 870 million. As forecast in previous reports, 5G is still expected to reach one billion subscriptions by the end of this year - two years faster than 4G did, following its launch.
The statistic reinforces 5G as the fastest-scaling mobile connectivity generation. Key drivers include the timely availability of devices from multiple vendors, with prices falling faster than for 4G, and China's large early 5G deployments.
North America and North East Asia continue to see strong 5G growth, with 5G subscription penetration in the regions expected to reach about 35 percent by end of 2022. 
Globally, almost 230 CSPs have launched 5G services to date, with more than 700 5G smartphone models announced or launched commercially.
By the end of 2028, five billion 5G subscriptions are forecast globally, accounting for 55 percent of all subscriptions. In that same timeframe, 5G population coverage is projected to reach 85 percent while 5G networks are expected to carry around 70 percent of mobile traffic and account for all contemporary traffic growth.
Fredrik Jejdling, Executive Vice President and Head of Networks, Ericsson, says: "Communications Service providers continue to deploy 5G and the momentum for Fixed Wireless Access is accelerating. Moreover, global mobile network data traffic is practically doubling every two years. As described in this edition of the Ericsson Mobility Report, service providers are taking actions to deploy the latest generation of energy-efficient radio hardware and software, increase the use of renewable energy sources, and operate site infrastructure intelligently to reduce the environmental impact."
Global 4G subscription numbers also continue to rise, growing by about 41 million between July and September 2022. Global 4G subscriptions are expected to reach a peak of about 5.2 billion around the end of this year.
Overall mobile subscriptions are expected to top 8.4 billion by the end of 2022, and 9.2 billion by the end of 2028. Most subscriptions are associated with smartphones. At the end of 2022, 6.6 billion smartphone subscriptions are estimated, accounting for about 79 percent of all mobile phone subscriptions
The latest report also highlights the importance of reducing environmental impact. The telecommunications sector has a key role to play in addressing global sustainability goals, both by reducing its own emissions and through its potential to reduce carbon emissions across other industries.
To reduce the environmental impact, the growing data traffic needs to be managed with smart network modernization combined with a balanced approach to network performance.
The November 2022 Ericsson Mobility Report includes three in-depth articles:             
- Network modernization - on the quest for Net Zero

- Cooperation and collaborating: Building Finland's next-generation public safety network

- Digitalization enables enterprises to reach Net Zero

Ericsson will host an Ericsson Mobility Report-focused webinar at 09.00 (CET) and 19.00 (CET) on Wednesday, November 30. To join please register here

Full text: The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announces its decision to grant a limited 5-year exemption to Rosco, Inc. to allow motor carriers to operate commercial vehicles (CVs) with the company's CV Digital Camera Monitor System (CMS) called DCAMS, as an alternative to rear-vision mirrors required by Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs).
JAMAICA, N.Y., Nov. 29, 2022  /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Rosco, Inc. dba Rosco Vision, applied for an exemption from 49 CFR 393.80(a) to allow its CV Digital CMS, named DCAMS (Digital Camera and Monitor System) to be installed as an alternative to automotive rear-vision mirrors through Docket No. FMCSA-2021-0186. FMCSA has reviewed the Rosco CV Digital CMS submission and believes that the Rosco DCAMS is likely to achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level of safety than standard rear-view mirrors. FMCSA has determined that the Rosco DCAMS exceeds both the FOV required by FMVSS No. 111 and rear-vision mirrors currently installed by manufacturers. The exemption is applicable December 4, 2022 and ending December 4, 2027.
Offering better visibility around the vehicle, the Rosco DCAMS has been engineered to replace rear-vision mirrors on commercial vehicles. The digital cameras and monitors cover views shown in both the flat and convex lenses of rear-vision mirrors.    
The Rosco DCAMS includes two monitors and two housings for the connected cameras. The two monitors are mounted on each of the a-pillars providing the driver with an enhanced field-of-vision (FOV) and clearer images in all weather conditions. The DCAMS monitors provide superior visibility and brighter images during the day and night, and include heated cameras to prevent frost on lenses in cold temperatures. The aerodynamic design of the camera housings offers fuel savings and efficient operations, while the low profile and high mounting location reduces the risk of impacts with objects, thus reducing costs associated with damage.
About Rosco:
Rosco is a leading global supplier of vision safety solutions to the bus and truck marketplace with over 115 years of engineering and manufacturing experience. Since 1907, Rosco has been headquartered in New York City, keeping their products engineered, manufactured, and supported in the USA.

Full text: CALGARY, AB, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - Enbridge Inc. (Enbridge or the Company) (TSX: ENB) (NYSE: ENB) announced today that it has completed the previously announced transaction relating to its partnership agreement with Pacific Energy Corporation Limited (Pacific Energy) to jointly invest in the construction and operation of the Woodfibre LNG project, located near Squamish, B.C. Enbridge now has a 30% ownership stake in the Woodfibre LNG project, with Pacific Energy retaining the remaining 70% stake in the project.
Pacific Energy and Enbridge will each make pro-rata contributions during construction through a combination of expected asset level financing and equity investments. In exchange for its capital contribution, Enbridge will receive a preferred equity interest that provides predictable future cash flows. The partners will jointly participate in the project's execution and governance of ongoing operations, while Pacific Energy retains responsibility for daily operations.
Preliminary construction activities, including site preparation are underway. The project remains on track for its targeted in-service date of Q4 2027.
Forward-Looking Information
Forward-looking information, or forward-looking statements, have been included in this news release to provide information about Enbridge Inc. ("Enbridge" or the "Company") and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including management's assessment of Enbridge and its subsidiaries' future plans and operations. This information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as ''anticipate'', ''expect'', ''project'', ''estimate'', ''forecast'', ''plan'', ''intend'', ''target'', ''believe'', "likely" and similar words suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook. Forward-looking information or statements in this news release include statements with respect to Woodfibre LNG project and Enbridge's investment therein, including expected in service dates, and anticipated financing and capital contributions.
Although Enbridge believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable based on the information available on the date such statements are made and processes used to prepare the information, such statements are not guarantees of future performance and readers are cautioned against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements. By their nature, these statements involve a variety of assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results, levels of activity and achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Assumptions regarding the expected supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquified natural gas, renewable energy and other commodities, and the prices of these commodities, are material to and underlie all forward-looking statements, as they may impact current and future levels of demand for the Company's services and other energy-related services and products. Similarly, energy transition, including the drivers and pace thereof, exchange rates, inflation and interest rates impact the economies and business environments in which the Company operates and may impact levels of demand for the Company's and others' services and products and cost of inputs, and are therefore inherent in all forward-looking statements. Due to the interdependencies and correlation of these macroeconomic factors, the impact of any one assumption on a forward-looking statement cannot be determined with certainty. The most relevant assumptions associated with forward-looking statements on announced projects and projects under construction, including estimated in-service dates and the realization of anticipated benefits, include the following: the impact of litigation and government, regulatory and stakeholder actions and approvals on construction and in-service schedules; the availability and price of labour and construction materials; the stability of the supply chain; the effects of inflation and foreign exchange rates on labour and material costs; the effects of interest rates on borrowing costs; technology-related matters; the impact of weather; and expectations about our partners' ability to complete and finance proposed projects.
Enbridge's forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those risks and uncertainties discussed in this news release and in the Company's other filings with Canadian and United States securities regulators. The impact of any one risk, uncertainty or factor on a particular forward-looking statement is not determinable with certainty as these are interdependent and Enbridge's future course of action depends on management's assessment of all information available at the relevant time. Except to the extent required by applicable law, Enbridge assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements made in this news release or otherwise, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All subsequent forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, attributable to Enbridge or persons acting on the Company's behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements.

- Investor partners to receive equity minority ownership stake, committed to development of Cboe Digital
- Aim to leverage Cboe's experience as a global market operator and expertise of partner firms to create foundation for Cboe Digital that will help it play a role in evolving digital asset ecosystem globally

CHICAGO, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), a leading provider of global market infrastructure and tradable products, announced it has completed the syndication of minority equity interests with a group of thirteen firms becoming investor partners in the Cboe Digital business. 
The investors represent a broad and diverse range of market participants, including leading retail and institutional intermediaries, liquidity providers and brokers, including B2C2, DRW, Galaxy Digital, GSR, Hidden Road, IMC, Interactive Brokers, Jane Street, Jump Crypto, Robinhood, Susquehanna International Group, tastyworks and Virtu Financial. Through their equity ownership, each firm will directly benefit from the growth of Cboe Digital and close strategic and commercial alignment. The group of investor partners join a roster of commercial partner firms supporting the Cboe Digital business.
"We are pleased to have this group of investor partners joining us as equity owners of Cboe Digital, with many of them already fully onboarded to the Cboe Digital platform and the remainder expected to be completed in the coming months," said John Palmer, President of Cboe Digital. "Each of these partners share Cboe's deep commitment to bringing a trusted, regulatory-first approach to the digital asset space. The time is right for the Cboe Digital model in the digital asset space, and we look forward to leveraging the combined expertise of these firms as we work together to grow, shape and define this asset class to benefit market participants across the globe." 
"Cboe Digital's foundation is based on the core tenets of a trusted financial exchange – transparency, regulatory oversight, and customer protection – underpinned by responsible innovation and the value of an intermediary-driven model," said John Deters, Chief Strategy Officer, Cboe Global Markets. "Together with our partner firms, we will look to explore opportunities across digitization, including discovering new areas of tradable products specific to managing digital asset risk, building new digital technology in a safe and compliant way, and helping craft the future of digital assets with proven market expertise and regulatory experience, which we believe will help the space mature and ultimately grow."
Additionally, as part of its operation of the Cboe Digital business, Cboe plans to form a Digital Advisory Committee comprised of a cross-section of investor and commercial partner firms. The committee will be tasked with advising Cboe on the ongoing development of the Cboe Digital spot and derivatives markets, and more broadly, the digital asset space.

Full text: News Media Contact: Todd Meyers, (724) 838-6650; Investor Contact: Irene Prezelj, (330) 384-3859
READING, Pa., Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- With winter weather right around the corner, Met-Ed, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE), is completing equipment inspections and maintenance to help keep power flowing to customers to keep them safe and comfortable during the chilly months ahead. 
"Our winter preparations focus on readying our electric distribution and transmission systems to safely deliver electricity to our customers when they need it most to stay warm," said Scott Wyman, president of FirstEnergy's Pennsylvania Operations. "By working proactively to safeguard our power infrastructure and prepare our utility vehicles and personnel, we will be better positioned to respond to the challenges presented by freezing temperatures, windstorms and snowstorms." 
Substation electricians inspect critical components using "thermovision" cameras, which capture infrared images of equipment to detect potential problems that are not visible during regular visual inspections. The infrared images show heat on a color scale, with brighter colors or "hot spots" indicating loose connections, corrosion or other problems that require repairs. Utility workers can then proactively repair substation equipment to help prevent power outages as customers crank up their heaters to combat the cold.
Some larger substations have buildings that house remote-controlled equipment that must be in a climate-controlled environment to function properly. Crews winterize those control buildings and ensure their heating systems are ready for the season.
Helicopter inspections are being completed on approximately 1,400 miles of transmission lines located in the Met-Ed footprint. The inspections are designed to look for damaged wire, broken cross arms and other hardware problems invisible from the ground. Potential reliability issues identified during the inspection may then be addressed.
Tree trimming throughout the year also helps meet the rigors of winter operations by maintaining proper clearances around electrical systems and helping to protect against tree-related outages caused by heavy, wet snow, high winds and ice. Met-Ed tree contractors have trimmed more than 2,700 miles of electric lines this year and are on track to complete more than 3,300 total miles of trimming by the end of 2022.
Additionally, bucket trucks and other vehicles are inspected to ensure they are safe and able to function in freezing temperatures. Special emphasis is placed on the condition of tires and air brakes, which can freeze up if moisture is present. Snow removal equipment is also checked to ensure that crews are able to access substations and that work areas and sidewalks at company facilities are clear and safe.
Earlier this year, Met-Ed conducted its annual tabletop storm drill as another way to help ensure reliable electric service for customers. The drill is designed to prepare employees assigned to storm restoration duties and review restoration processes and storm-management tools critical to safely and quickly getting the lights back on after damage caused by severe weather.
Customers can review tips to prepare in advance of severe weather, and view restoration updates if storms do cause power outages, by visiting FirstEnergy's 24/7 Power Center at www.firstenergycorp.com/outages. 
With the winter storm season also comes frigid temperatures and rising energy costs. Customers can take steps to keep their homes comfortable while managing their electricity bill this cold season. The following tips can help customers use electricity wisely during this period of high demand:
- Set thermostats as low as comfort will allow. Every degree a customer can decrease the temperature in their home will result in using about 3 percent less energy during the winter.
- Seal any leaks around windows and door frames with caulk or weather stripping to prevent cold air from sneaking into your home.
- Close the fireplace damper when it is not in use to keep cold air out.
- Close the drapes at night. During the day, only open those that receive direct sunlight.
- Use a programmable or smart thermostat to keep temperatures lower when no one is home and to increase the temperature before arrival back home.
- Check furnace fan filters. Clogged filters waste energy and money by forcing a heating system to work harder than necessary.
- Make sure your home is properly insulated. If you have less than six inches of insulation, you'll benefit by adding more.
- Payment arrangements and assistance programs are available for customers who need help with their electric bills. For more information, visit www.firstenergycorp.com/billassist.

Met-Ed serves approximately 570,000 customers in 14 Pennsylvania counties. Follow Met-Ed on Twitter @Met Ed and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/MetEdElectric.
FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence. Its 10 electric distribution companies form one of the nation's largest investor-owned electric systems, serving customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and New York. The company's transmission subsidiaries operate approximately 24,000 miles of transmission lines that connect the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions.

Bio-Based Adhesives Emerging as an ideal alternative to Conventional Adhesives
The surge in the price of petrochemicals and the depletion of crude oil reserves worldwide is also stimulating the demand for bio-based adhesives. Bio-based adhesives are ideal alternatives to conventional adhesives based on petroleum products, which are harmful to the environment. The less toxic, high adhesive strength, metal adhesion, higher crosslinking density, and metal adhesion properties make bio-based adhesives suitable for wood, packaging, construction, and decorative industries. Thus, the global bio-based adhesive market is set to experience significant growth during the forecast period.
Due to product line extensions and continuous innovations, the market competition is expected to intensify further in the upcoming years. The scope for product differentiation is low in the market, and quality, functionality, price, and after-sales services, are decisive variables that affect the sales of bio-based adhesive products.

Full text: An increase across all of the TASE's key performance indicators; adjusted EBITDA exceeded NIS 30 million and recorded a growth of over 30% compared to the same quarter last year
- 15% growth in revenues in the third quarter, amounting to NIS 86 million, compared to revenues of NIS 75 million in the same quarter last year.
- 34% growth in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, amounting to NIS 30.5 million, compared to revenues of NIS 22.8 million in the same quarter last year
- The adjusted profit in the third quarter reached almost NIS 8.8 million, a 10% decrease compared to the adjusted profit in the same quarter last year, mainly due to the increase in financing expenses.

Ittai Ben Zeev, CEO of TASE : "TASE is continuing its organic growth trajectory and has recorded an increase of 15% in revenues, an increase in all areas of activity and an increase of more than 34% in EBITDA compared to the same quarter last year. Despite the storms and high volatility in global markets, TASE is continuing to maintain stability and resilience compared to the world's leading stock exchanges, with an increase of almost 30% in trading volumes compared to last year, reaching a daily average of NIS 2.4 billion since the beginning of the year."
TEL AVIV, Israel, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE: TASE) reports its financial results for the third quarter of the year ended September 30, 2022.
TASE is continuing to show strength compared to the world's stock exchanges in this volatile period as well. Share trading in the first nine months of the year amounted to moderate decreases in rates compared to those recorded on the world's leading stock exchanges: The TA-35 index and TA-90 index were down an average 9% compared to a decrease of 25% and 21% in the S&P 500 and Dow Jones in the USA, respectively, and a decrease of 23% and 27% in the EURO STOXX 50 in Europe and the global MSCI, respectively. The TA-Oil & Gas index was the only index that increased during those months with a rise of 48% due to the effect of the increasing energy crisis in Europe and the growth in demand for natural gas imports from Israel, together with the rise in oil and gas prices. Vigorous trading volumes with a daily average of NIS 2.4 billion was recorded on the stock market in the nine months, a figure that is 27% higher than the average volume in the entire 2021. The increase in trading volumes was due mainly to the volatility of the share prices and the increasing investments by foreign residents in shares on TASE, with NIS 12.6 billion net in January to August, 2022, further to acquisitions amounting to NIS 13 billion net in the entire 2021.
TASE recently presented a new strategic plan for the coming five years that includes 4 key objectives: strengthening TASE's international profile as a global financial center, development of direct activity with the end customer, assessment of the establishment of a location-based platform for digital assets (DLT) and the sale of technological services and solutions intended for foreign stock exchanges . 
Based on TASE's goals, the strategic plan is expected to increase revenue CAGR by 10%-12% over the next five years, as a result of organic growth in activity. TASE intends to promote a restructuring that will support the implementation of the strategic plan; this will include a structure similar to that of other stock exchanges around the world, of a holding company under which various subsidiaries will operate that will be set up to implement the plan's objectives. TASE also intends to assess a program of strategic acquisitions and investments in its areas of activity and other areas of activity that will generate added value.
As part of the examinations that TASE performed in relation to the restructuring, TASE have received an opinion from a corporate law expert professor. According to the opinion, the amendment to the Securities Law determines that the historic TASE members that were shareholders shortly before the restructuring are not entitled to receive for their shares – as a dividend, in a sale or otherwise – any amount exceeding the shareholders equity of TASE in 2015. Therefore, the maximum consideration that the historical shareholders members may receive upon the sale of those shares must be adjusted for all the dividends that have been and that will actually be distributed by TASE, up to the sale of the shares . In accordance with the amendment to the Law, the maximum consideration receivable by the historical TASE members that hold the Shares is NIS 5.08 per share. To date, and pursuant to the opinion, the consideration is NIS 4.58 per share, in dividend-adjusted values. The difference between the share price at the time of sale and the dividend-adjusted price will be transferred to TASE and will be used for technological upgrades and developments of the TASE's systems.
Below are the key results of the quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2022:
Revenues in the third quarter of 2022 amounted to a total of NIS 86 million compared to revenues in the same quarter last year of NIS 75 million, an increase of 15%. In the quarter, a growth in revenues was recorded in all activities:
Revenues from trading and clearing commissions  amounted to NIS 33.4 million, a growth of 16% compared to the same quarter last year, mainly as a result of an increase in trading volumes between the periods. The Company's trading and clearing revenues were impacted, inter alia, by the number of trading and clearing days. The number of trading days in the third quarter of 2022 amounted to 61 compared to 56 in the same quarter last year, an increase of 9%.
Revenues from listing fees and levies recorded a growth of 18% to an amount of NIS 19.9 million, mainly resulting from a growth in revenues from listing fees and an increase in annual levies due to an increase in the number of companies and funds.
An increase of 9% was recorded in clearing service revenues , due mainly to a rise in revenues from clearing services to members.
Revenues from the distribution of information and connectivity  increased at a rate of 11% to NIS 14.4 million, mainly due to an increase in revenues of 6% from the distribution of information to business customers outside Israel, primarily in view of an increase in activity and changes in the price list that came into effect in the second quarter of the year. Furthermore, the increase in revenues from connectivity services and the sale of information through the API services lead to a 2% rise in revenues in each.
Revenues in the nine months of 2022 recorded an increase of 15% in the period, amounting to a total of NIS 274.7 million compared to revenues in the same quarter last year of NIS 237.9 million. The increase in revenues is due to an increase in all activities, with emphasis on a 15% rise in the trading and clearing segments and an increase of 26% in revenues from listing fees and levies, including the effect of a change in the estimated listing fee revenues for the recognized period, which is 3% of the total increase. We should recall that in the second quarter of 2021, with the signing of an agreement between the TASE and the Ministry of Finance, nonrecurring revenue in the amount of NIS 3.8 million was included in respect of listing fees of government bonds in the lending pool.
Costs in the third quarter of 2022  amounted to a total of NIS 68.8 million compared to NIS 64.4 million in the same quarter last year, an increase of 7%.  The rise in costs is due mainly to an increase in marketing expenses (4% of the total costs), an increase in depreciation expenses (2% of the total costs), and an increase in IT and communication expenses and general and administrative expenses that were partially offset by a decrease in employee benefit expenses.
Costs in the nine months of 2022  amounted to a total of NIS 210.3 million compared to NIS 200.5 million in the same period last year, an increase of 5%. The increase in costs is due mainly to an increase in in depreciation and amortization expenses, marketing expenses, employee benefits and IT and communication expenses (1% of the total costs).
Net finance expenses in the third quarter of 2022 amounted to a total of NIS 4.1 million compared to NIS 1.8 million in the same quarter last year. The transition to finance expenses in the quarter is due to a negative return of 2.2% on the Company's investments in Israeli government bonds managed in the marketable securities portfolios, compared to a positive return of 1.0% in the same quarter last year.
Net finance expenses in the nine months of 2022  amounted to a total of NIS 12.8 million compared net finance expenses in the same period last year, which amounted to NIS 3.3 million. The transition to finance expenses in the quarter is due to a negative return of 6.4% on the Company's investments in Israeli government bonds managed in the marketable securities portfolios, compared to a positive return of 1.8% in the same period last year.
Net tax expenses in the third quarter of 2022  amounted to a total of NIS 4.4 million compared to NIS 2.7 million in the same quarter last year. The increase in expenses is due to a rise in earnings before tax and a decrease in the fair value of the Company's investments in government bonds for which no deferred taxes were created.
Net tax expenses in the nine months of 2022  amounted to a total of NIS 14.0 million compared to NIS 9.3 million in the same period last year. The increase in expenses is due to a rise in earnings before tax and a decrease in the fair value of the Company's investments in government bonds for which no deferred taxes were created.
Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2022  amounted to a total of NIS 30.5 million compared to NIS 22.8 million in the same quarter last year, an increase of 34%. The increase is due to an increase in revenues of 15% as a result of an increase in activities and a rise in expenses of 6%, mainly in respect of the timing of marketing costs.
Adjusted EBITDA in the nine months of 2022  amounted to a total of NIS 103.1 million compared to NIS 73.5 million in the same period last year. The increase is due to an increase in revenues of 15% mainly as a result of an increase in activities, offset by an increase in expenses of 4%, primarily in respect of marketing costs and employee benefits.
Earnings in the third quarter of 2022  amounted to a total of NIS 8.7 million compared to NIS 9.6 million in the same quarter last year, an increase of 10%. The decrease in earnings is due mainly to finance expenses resulting from a negative return on the Company's investments in financial assets held for trading and an increase in tax expenses, which were partially offset by an increase in earnings before finance expenses, as specified above.
Earnings in the nine months of 2022  amounted to a total of NIS 37.6 million compared to NIS 31.4 million in the same period last year, an increase of 20%. The increase is due to an increase in revenues from services, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses, transition to finance expenses and an increase in tax expenses.
Adjusted earnings in the third quarter of 2022 amounted to a total of NIS 8.8 million compared to NIS 9.8 million in the same quarter last year, a decrease of 10%. This is while operating profit increased at a rate of 64% compared to the same quarter last year.

Full text: The Fund is raising a $20,000,000 Series A Round
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Education Opportunity Zone Fund LLC launches seeking accredited capital gains investors for "Heroes League Game Day" ED Tech platform. The Fund is raising a $20,000,000 Series A Round.
The education of our children and the future workforce and the future of our country is in a crisis. There is less learning time, less teacher time, less parent time, more demands from the business community, and less engagement for students, i.e. they would rather watch mindless videos on Tiktok than learn how to create something of value. The negative academic, social and economic outcomes are accelerating, which make our children and our country less competitive and less likely to succeed.
Heroes League Game Day has been designed from the ground up to use "technology for good" to help solve this perfect storm of problems. Using the same game science that addicts kids to games, to get them hooked on learning the Top20 life-skills of success such as communication, teamwork, critical thinking, entrepreneurship and many more. Learning these skills delivers academic, social and economic success.
Bringing together the teachers, school administrators, government, parents, business and students and deliver a kid-driven, game-based skills learning platform that puts the child and the community back in a global leadership position.
Just a few extra minutes a day in the game has been proven to correlate to higher state reading and math test scores, the more the student plays the game. This "extended learning" time delivers what most parents, businesses and the community want – a child that is prepared to succeed.
A recent pilot program in Ohio using Heroes League online education and life skills game showed improvement in test scores among students who spent the most time playing the game. Thomas Reed, director of data, research and grants advancement at the Educational Service Center of Central Ohio, spoke on the success of the platform used during recent pilot programs at Canal Winchester, Chesapeake and one other northeast Ohio school district that was not named during a press conference held on November 14, 2022 at the Statehouse.
Reed noted the toll the pandemic had on students and test scores, and said that the pilot program showed there are ways to bridge the achievement gap. The pilot looked at scores of students who used the Heroes League Game Day platform over the course of a year and found those who used it the most saw improved scores. The improvement was also seen among minority students and those with disabilities.
The study looked at a pool of 154 students in the Canal Winchester school district grades 3-5. The pool of students included 44.6 percent minority, 20 percent with disabilities, and 30.4 percent students who are economically disadvantaged.
All subgroups showed improvement in test scores for students who played Heroes League Game Day for 10 to 60 minutes per day. The study also showed a reduced achievement gap for minority students.
Sen. Andrew Brenner (R-Delaware), chair of the Senate Education Committee, said at the event, "lawmakers and the Ohio Department of Education have been trying to look for high-quality programs that get kids engaged." He noted "that there is still federal money available for remediation of student learning affected by the pandemic, and that some of that money will be used for programs such as the Heroes League Game Day. Additionally programs like the Opportunity Zone program can be used to help accelerate educational based learning programs into areas that need them the most."
Heroes League Game Day is an online skills game where students learn 20 skills meant to help them to succeed in education and in life and is massively scalable because the students don't need classroom or teacher time and it is optimized to run on a low-end education Chromebook that can't do gaming - a device that 90% of K-6 students in Ohio and other states are using. It is currently funded through existing state education funds because it delivers more and better data that matters to all stakeholders surrounding that child.
Everyone wins – the parent sees their child getting educated properly, the teachers spend less time delivering more learning outcomes, the schools retain their students and funding, the business community gets a workforce with better skills and preparation, the government benefits from better communities that are safer and produce more economic power, and ultimately the student has greater hope of a successful life.
"Heroes League Game Day brings parents, teachers, kids, government, and businesses together to deliver the life-skills training and hope that a child needs to succeed. By using the science of game-based learning, we motivate students to learn the life-skills of success -all without the need for classroom or teacher time. We have developed this world leading education solution by serving over 10 million students over many years to deliver what they and their communities need," said fund manager Scott Dow.
The investment into this type of educational learning is a necessity as it delivers improved outcomes for students, their parents, businesses, and the country. The ability to leverage an Opportunity Zone Fund for investors with capital gains looking to defer taxes for this year to tax year 2026 and the ability to grow tax free for 10 years now allows Heroes League Game Day to expand nationally. "The Opportunity Zone program fits perfectly into our mission of reaching kids that need our learning platform the most,"said Scott Dow Fund Manager. "Additionally, the Education OZ Fund is the first education focused Opportunity Zone Fund in the country."
"US Federal, State and Local governments are focused on providing critical assistance for lifelong self-improvement to low-income families and communities. Over 8,000 Opportunity Zones were designated with significant tax benefits to encourage investment. Opportunity Zone investing initially focused on real estate, but stakeholders now realize investing in small business has far greater potential for improving academic, social, and economic outcomes in Opportunity Zones. Government specifically identified education as a critical pillar for families in Opportunity Zones," said Shay Hawkins who served as a lead policy advisor for U.S. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), as president and chief executive officer of the Opportunity Funds Association.
The Education Opportunity Zone Fund is a qualified single asset fund offering sophisticated investors a tax leveraged conduit to invest in Next Mission Inc., an innovative high growth education technology company delivering the proven Heroes League Game Day learning platform.
Education is about to be disrupted by technology the same way Amazon did for retail and Apple did for music. The Heroes League platform is perfectly positioned to capitalize on those market forces and become a leader in educating the upcoming generation to lead and take on the coming challenges in the next generation digital world that brings physical and virtual worlds together..
All students, regardless of their economic circumstance deserve the very best education that can be provided, and we as a superpower need the very best workforce to maintain our position in the global economy.

Full text: LONDON, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The companies operating in electric vehicle (EV) batteries market are adopting lithium-ion batteries because of their advantages such as high energy density in the rechargeable-battery market, making them easier and faster to charge and long-lasting. These batteries also need low maintenance and have no memory effect, which causes batteries to underperform after repeated partial discharge and charge cycles. Lithium-ion batteries are ideal for electric vehicles due to their high performance and long shelf life. For instance, Tesla, the electric vehicle manufacturer, uses lithium-ion batteries in their electric vehicle models.

Data Security Concerns Inhibit Electric Vehicle (EV) Batteries Market Growth
The growing demand for electric vehicles is a key driver of the electric vehicle (EV) batteries market. Electric vehicles are vehicles that operate with an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine. EVs have significantly improved to compete with the gasoline-powered vehicles that are the current industry standard. Technologies such as advanced driver-assistance systems are widely used in autonomous and electric cars.
Electric Vehicle (EV) Batteries Market Restraint – High Manufacturing Costs
As per the electric vehicle (EV) batteries market research, the high cost of creating electric cars and related components like batteries and monitoring systems (battery management systems, controller area network (CAN) bus modules) is a key restraint for electric vehicle producers. EV batteries need rare earth metals such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel, which are not readily available. The metals have to be mined and processed to be used in EV batteries. The expense of developing a charging infrastructure for electric vehicles is also very high, hence limiting the growth of the electric vehicle (EV) batteries market.
Key Players In The Electric Vehicle (EV) Batteries Market
Major players in the electric vehicle (EV) batteries market are Panasonic Corporation, Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, Beijing Pride New Energy Battery Technology Co. Ltd, Automotive Energy Supply Corporation, BYD Company Ltd, Daimler AG, Robert Bosch GmbH, SAMSUNG SDI CO, Tianneng Power International Co. Ltd, and Johnson Controls.

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- TrialSpark announced today the formation of Libertas Bio following the acquisition of a majority position in a portfolio of immunodermatology assets from Asana BioSciences. The Libertas Bio pipeline now includes global rights to gusacitinib, an oral Phase 3-ready dual JAK/SYK inhibitor in development for chronic hand eczema, and ASN008, a Phase 2-ready topical sodium channel blocker in development for pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis. Libertas Bio will continue the development of these assets, leveraging TrialSpark's tech-enabled drug development capabilities to bring these therapies to patients faster and more efficiently. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
After acquiring a portfolio of immunodermatology assets from Asana BioSciences, TrialSpark forms Libertas Bio. Gusacitinib has the potential to be the first oral therapy approved in the US for the treatment of chronic hand eczema (CHE). In a phase 2b study, Gusacitinib 80mg was shown to have a statistically significant and potentially clinically meaningful improvement across both primary and secondary endpoints and was well tolerated. CHE is an underserved condition with high unmet need, impacting up to 10% of adults, with no approved treatments in the US and few available off label options. CHE has a significant negative impact on quality of life, including psychosocial health and workforce productivity, and can lead to a number of comorbidities such as sleep disturbance and depression.
ASN008 has shown promising efficacy data in pruritus (itch) associated with atopic dermatitis, and is a Phase 2-ready complementary pipeline program to gusacitinib. Chronic itch is a hallmark of atopic dermatitis, which impacts more than 16.5 million patients in the US. ASN008 has the potential to be used in combination with other topical and systemic therapies in atopic dermatitis, as well as a meaningful opportunity to expand into other itch and pain related indications.
"We are excited about the opportunity to add these important products to our portfolio of development assets," said Dr. Gavin Corcoran, TrialSpark's Chief Medical Officer. "Both chronic hand eczema and itch are conditions that negatively affect the lives of the patients that have them, as well as their families. An effective treatment has the potential to improve the quality of life for both."
Beyond gusacitinib and ASN008, the transaction also included a preclinical dual JAK/SYK inhibitor named ASN011. Libertas Bio is open to in-licensing additional complementary products to build a differentiated pipeline focused on immunodermatology treatments.
Prior to this transaction, TrialSpark has in-licensed multiple assets, deploying capital and pursuing the development of drug programs as part of its mission to bring new treatments to patients faster and more efficiently. As part of its business development strategy, TrialSpark uses balance sheet capital to develop, acquire and/or license assets, leveraging its in-house drug development engine to run trials significantly faster and more efficiently than industry standards.
TrialSpark is actively pursuing partnerships with both small biotech and larger pharma companies through flexible and creative collaboration structures, maximizing the potential value of drug candidates for all stakeholders through faster and more efficient clinical development programs. For example, the company recently partnered with global pharmaceutical company Sanofi to jointly acquire and develop novel therapies. TrialSpark is focused on clinical stage assets in rheumatology, dermatology, CNS, and cardiometabolic diseases, with a focus on chronic diseases that are treated outside of a hospital setting.
About TrialSpark Founded in 2016, TrialSpark is a tech-driven pharma company differentiated by radically more efficient drug development. TrialSpark has built a technology platform that optimizes all aspects of clinical drug development, enabling more efficient trial design, faster trial completion, and higher quality trial data. The company acquires clinical-stage drugs from pharmaceutical and biotech companies and develops them faster, unlocking greater value per program and accelerating access to new treatments for patients. TrialSpark's current therapeutic areas of focus include rheumatology, dermatology, CNS, and cardiometabolic diseases.

Girls grow stronger and parents get support strengthening their daughters through BLOOMFULLY, a company focused on strengthening the minds and hearts of American Girls through Singers Company (ages 3-11) and I Believe in Me (ages 11-13).  
LADERA RANCH, Calif., Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Bloomfully , LLC, a nationwide company promoting strong minds and strong hearts in strong girls, launches this holiday season offering strategic solutions to protect girls against the ever-growing mental health crisis among America's youth. Bloomfully offers Singers Company and I Believe in Me, two different programs for different age groups, but both focused on strengthening the minds and hearts of young American girls. "Bloomfully was created to face head-on the jaw-dropping decline in mental health of American girls. We know that when a girl is developing her talents and abilities and then sharing them with others, she is happier and stronger mentally. This grow-and-share mindset is our aim and we are hitting it head on! We invite girls across the country to come grow with us!" says Katie Parker, CEO of Bloomfully and founder of both programs.
When a girl is developing her talents and sharing them with others, she is happier and stronger mentally. Singers Company  is designed for elementary-age girls and focuses on strengthening their confidence through singing, dancing and performing. Set up as a franchise in 2011, the company now has more than 60 locations nationwide. Singers Company has touched the lives of and strengthened thousands of girls across the country.
"Best thing I've done for my girls HANDS DOWN! In Singers Company, girls get to be sweet girls! Singers Company has my heart. The founder is incredible, the program is incredible, our local director is beyond incredible, and their mission statement blows it out of the water! I think every town needs a Singers Company!" -- Singers Company Parent
I Believe in Me  is designed for girls 11-13 years old. This one-of-a-kind, garden-themed, online and interactive program guides and coaches girls on how to have a happy and healthy middle school experience.
I Believe in Me has already strengthened more than 200 girls in its pilot season. I Believe in Me provides each girl with a safe, personalized website that teaches real, immediate tools and habits for a lifetime of success in time management, relationships, developing talents, life habits and performance. Girls are instructed through weekly episodes called "Planting The Seeds," how-to tutorials called "Bloom videos," and monthly "How's it Growing" group Zoom calls. The program also covers skincare, fashion, make-up, mindset tools, crafts, baking and more! Parents are also supported as their daughter finds joy, friends and guidance on a safe, private platform. Get a sneak peek here.
"I just wanted to write and say a big thank you for what you've done for my daughter in the I Believe in Me program. She would be embarrassed if she knew I was writing to you, but she loves it. She constantly has fun, new ideas to improve herself. She follows all of your organizing tips, makes the cute crafts, uses the skincare and hairstyle ideas. She's started putting herself to bed earlier and making cool charts and inspiration boards. As a mom, this has been such a gift for her to have wonderful role models and teachers that she looks up to, when she doesn't always want to listen to me! You do such a great job presenting it in a fun way. This has been such a blessing during this unique transition to middle school. I can't thank you enough!"-- I Believe in Me Parent
Company Background Bloomfully was born of Singers Company, a franchise established in 2011. Loyal brand customers kept asking for more support for their middle school age girls, so I Believe in Me launched its pilot season in June 2020 and is now relaunching with the introduction of Bloomfully, "A place where girls grow." Bloomfully encourages and supports Strong Minds and Strong Hearts in Strong Girls.

Full text: DENISON, Texas, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Lawyer and Texas native Mike Ledbetter recently announced his Presidential candidacy for 2024 while offering free downloadable copies of his new book: "Nine Sovereign Kings: The Return of God." Filled with divinely inspired advice for an array of important issues facing the country, "Nine Sovereign Kings" is a guidebook to help heal a troubled nation. Ledbetter authored the volume using a technique that "makes full use of the capitalization rule that states a word may be capitalized to emphasize it," so that readers could understand the stressed importance of key words and concepts.
In a time of pessimism, division, and growing doubt, Ledbetter is also keenly aware that there are some who might wonder whether this is real? Whether our Creator could use something in this way! In Ledbetter's words:
" This work is inspired by our Creator, our Trinity God ! For our Creator has instructed me to give it "Free" to all our People! To let us all know that He is here to help "Save" and "Heal" our "People" and "Democracy!"
" He did it for our 'Founding Fathers' against every odd known or unknown at that time, where they still miraculously prevailed and became 'Free!' For as all of you remember, the world was under the 'Reign' of 'Life Tenured Rulers' – 'Kings' and 'Emperors' everywhere – when a handful of our 'Forefathers,' with 'One' they called the Creator, both overcame and changed all of that in our 'World!' So why would He not appear to guide us now? Especially, when the "Life Tenured" Supreme Court is hurting us, and our "Congress," "Capitol," and "Democracy" almost fell to "Coup d'etat" on January 6, 2021!"
Ledbetter then continues:
" And please make no mistake about it, we are still presently in danger . Especially when one of our current 'Rulers' is not listening to our Creator – the very reason why our 'Democracy' almost fell on January 6, 2021. Therefore, if our Democracy is to make it, any who we 'Elect' to Congress or President must free us from the 'Unaccountable' and 'Life Tenured' Supreme Court before it is too late!"
" If there is anything else beyond this book that I can ever do to help the 'American People,' I am here! For whatever we do to heal our People and Nation, it must be all of us, with our Creator, who do it "Together!"
"Please enjoy the book and share it with others . For it is "Free" to all our People, being from our Beloved Creator of our Declaration of Independence!

Full text: MILWAUKEE, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Ademi LLP is investigating Apollo Endosurgery (Nasdaq: APEN) for possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law in its transaction with Boston Scientific. 
Click here to learn how to join the action https://www.ademilaw.com/case/apollo-endosurgery-inc or call Guri Ademi toll-free at 866-264-3995.  There is no cost or obligation to you.
Ademi LLP alleges Apollo Endosurgery's financial outlook and prospects are excellent and yet Apollo Endosurgery shareholders are expected to collectively own only $10 per share. The transaction agreement unreasonably limits competing bids for Apollo Endosurgery by imposing a significant penalty if Apollo Endosurgery accepts a superior bid. Apollo Endosurgery insiders will receive substantial benefits as part of change of control arrangements.
We are investigating the conduct of Apollo Endosurgery's board of directors, and whether they are (i) fulfilling their fiduciary duties to all shareholders, and (ii) obtaining a fair and reasonable price for Apollo Endosurgery.
If you own Apollo Endosurgery common stock and wish to obtain additional information, please contact Guri Ademi either at gademi@ademilaw.com or toll-free: 866-264-3995, or https://www.ademilaw.com/case/apollo-endosurgery-inc.

Full text: Additions build continued momentum for growing proptech firm
NASHVILLE, Tenn., Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Fortress, a real estate technology firm that creates property management software solutions for apartment owners and operators, announces key hires in sales, marketing, product, and client service. Tiffany Bergstrom joins as Head of Sales, Marc Rutzen as Chief Marketing Officer, Ryan Strait as Vice President of Product, and Erin Cook as Director of Onboarding.
Tiffany Bergstrom brings years of strong sales experience to her role as Head of Sales of Fortress. Prior to joining the company, she worked as Director of Sales for WalkMe, a digital adoption platform, assisting businesses with their digital adoption experience. She is based in New York City and works remotely.
At Fortress, Bergstrom will combine her invaluable drive and knowledge to further the company's position as a top-tier software sales organization within the proptech industry by implementing a comprehensive and forward-thinking sales strategy.
Marc Rutzen has more than a decade of experience ranging from real estate development and brokerage to founding Enodo — a predictive analytics startup that projected the impact of value-add renovations on rent, expenses, and investment performance in multifamily assets. When Walker & Dunlop acquired Enodo in 2019, Rutzen joined the company and served as Senior Vice President of Information Technology before moving up to the role of Chief Product Officer. He is based in Chicago and works remotely.
As CMO at Fortress, Rutzen will oversee the company's overall advertising and sales strategy, including the structural development of the marketing department. He will also approve marketing campaign ideas and coordinate marketing efforts to align with the company's financial and branding goals.
As VP of Product, Ryan Strait brings years of experience in product management, marketing, consulting, and sales. Prior to joining the Fortress team, Strait served as VP of Product Strategy for a company in the government technology space, leading and executing strategy based on sound analysis and data-driven decision-making. She is based in Manhattan, Kansas and works remotely.
In her role at Fortress, Strait plans to delve deeper by further aligning the vision and direction of the product. She will also lead the product management and design teams in creating a product roadmap that fits the needs of both clients and company initiatives.
In her role as Director of Onboarding, Erin Cook is responsible for the development and oversight of engagement management, implementation, and digital adoption. She works to develop best practices and improve efficiencies to ensure the success of Fortress clients.
Cook previously served as a top-performing, multi-site business manager for a large multifamily property management firm. There, she piloted and helped shape the implementation of all new technology for the company. She is based in Collierville, Tennessee and works remotely.
With 15 years of experience in operations and asset management under her belt, Cook says she is excited to contribute to the creative, collective vision of Fortress.
Since a strategic investment from Walker & Dunlop in November of last year, Fortress' team has grown to nearly 50.
Fortress Founder and CEO Kerri Davis says she is looking forward to seeing firsthand the positive impact the recent hires will have on the company's continued upward trajectory.
"We are thrilled to welcome such talented innovators and leaders to our growing team," said Davis. "They will join the ranks of ambitious people who are passionate about the Fortress product and user experience. With these hires, we continue to build momentum and propel the growth of Fortress into 2023 and beyond."
Continued Innovation Ahead
Fortress' mission is to propel the real estate industry forward by creating modern solutions and collaborating with customers. To do so, the property management software is always looking for talented individuals to join the team.
A fully-remote company with an office in Nashville, Fortress team members value:
- Knowing when to grind, and when to breathe
- Observing, then contributing
- Making new mistakes
- Challenging directly, caring personally
- Holding themselves and others accountable

About Fortress
Fortress is a property management software product created on the basis that property management software should be easy, transparent, and informative.

Fortress recovers lost time and money through in-system training, support from the perspective of a property management company and real-time data for immediate knowledge and action. Fortress is based in Nashville, Tennessee. To learn more, visit Fortresstech.io.

Shares Eye-opening Stats of Sexual Abuse in Sports and the Simple Actions that Everyone Can Take to Help Prevent Misconduct
WOODSIDE, Calif., Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- #WeRideTogether, a movement to empower, inform, and unite the sports community on sexual abuse prevention, is continuing its efforts to bring awareness to and spark dialogue around the very important subject of sexual misconduct in sports. There are an increasing number of reports in the media that point to sexual violence becoming alarmingly commonplace. Seemingly daily, there is a new story around the egregious acts of abuse committed by individuals in power positions and those who continue to turn a blind eye to widespread misconduct. "We Can" is the latest in the #WeRideTogether series of educational and impactful PSAs created to share its mission. 
#WERIDETOGETHER LAUNCHES "WE CAN" PSA NARRATED BY ESPN COMMENTATOR, JAY BILAS, AND DAUGTHER, TORI Tapping renowned ESPN analyst and former NBA player, Jay Bilas, " We Can"  plays off the idea that not everybody can hit a buzzer-beater 3-pointer in basketball, serve an ace in tennis or roll back to a 1.60m oxer in equestrian, but everyone can take simple actions to prevent sexual misconduct in sport. Anyone Can "say something when they see something, speak up and speak out and hold trainers and athletes accountable for their actions."
Jay and Tori take turns sharing the high-impact narrative around the facts of sexual misconduct, underscoring that 1 in every 4 college athletes has been sexually abused by an authority figure* and 50% of athletes have reported some form of sexual harassment**.  They remind us that Everyone Can make a difference no matter who they are, what they do, or where they play.   
"There is strength in knowing that anyone can make a difference through a simple action or reaction. As a former pro basketball player and current sports commentator, I am honored to lend my voice to help bring awareness to a very important subject and share little ways for people to make big changes," said Jay Bilas.  
#WeRideTogether is a true movement and cultural shift that demands increased accountability from trainers and coaches, gives survivors a safe platform to share their voices, and aims to diminish the stigma and fear of coming forward to report abuse.

Full text: Nok Nok's S3 Suite brings Next Level MFA to UberEther's IAM Advantage Platform
SAN JOSE, Calif., Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Nok Nok, a leader in FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) authentication solutions and a founder of the FIDO Alliance, today announced it is partnering with UberEther, a leading provider of identity and access management solutions to the federal government. Together they will extend FedRAMP certification of UberEther's IAM Advantage platform with innovative cybersecurity capabilities requested by some of the world's highest-profile agencies and organizations.
FedRAMP's standards-based approach to security assessment and authorization enables federal agencies, customers, and their suppliers to transition from insecure legacy IT infrastructure to mission-enabling, secure, and continuously-monitored cloud solutions with an increased focus on securing and protecting federal information.
UberEther's IAM Advantage model is FedRAMP High and DoD Impact Level 5 ready, which means that even the most closely monitored companies can run their identity in the cloud more securely, efficiently, and effectively. Once UberEther is fully FedRAMP authorized, it will have one of the only private-tenant, cloud identity solutions available in the federal marketplace that government agencies use to find compliant, FedRAMP-approved cloud services. This designation builds on UberEther's highest commitment to security standards.
"Nok Nok is very honored to partner with UberEther to deliver trusted IAM solutions to the largest government agencies with built-in next-level MFA that meets the highest levels of security," said Nok Nok CEO Phillip Dunkelberger. "Nok Nok's FIDO authentication solutions add key features and benefits per the federal mandate in the White House's 2021 Cybersecurity Executive Order that defines how the government will lead by example in adopting best of breed cybersecurity capabilities. Nok Nok and UberEther's partnership adds new innovation to mandated FedRAMP solutions that enables government agencies and their supplier networks to become phishing-resistant and therefore more secure, while also becoming easier to use."
"At UberEther, we're extremely excited to be working with Nok Nok on this opportunity to bring phishing-resistant credentials to the federal government," said Matt Topper, President and CEO, UberEther. "We're not only focused on enabling citizens and partners of the federal government to connect to services more securely, but we're also enabling service members, civilians, government employees, and contractors to work with mission-critical systems more easily."
"We all know that zero trust is the future of security within the federal government and worldwide, and identity is the first pillar of zero trust that we need to protect the nation. With Nok Nok inside, government agencies and their suppliers will be able to offer more secure sign-in and a great user experience that's better than anything we've been able to provide before," continued Topper.
Robert Lentz, a member of Nok Nok's Board of Advisors and who served our nation as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense and the first Chief Information Security Officer for the Department of Defense added, "I am excited about the future that Nok Nok and UberEther are creating. With FIDO passkeys built into device hardware and software applications, and now FedRAMP standards incorporating phishing-resistant MFA, we are keeping our nation's networks safe along with the agencies, partners, civilians, and government employees who use these networks".

DGS CLEARSKY™ Technology and Software Alert Stakeholders of Radio Frequency Threats
TYSONS, Va., Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Indra Sistemas, S.A,, a leading global technology engineering company for the aerospace, defense, and mobility sectors, has integrated leading-edge RF detection from Digital Global Systems (DGS) into its CROW counter-UAS platform. With DGS RF detection, CROW adapts to the specific needs of the environment being protected; integrates and combines use of different sensors and countermeasures; with the possibility of redundant use of sensors in terms of both number and location.
Advancements in wireless and computer processing have enabled devices to become smaller and more capable. Just as innovation has delivered increased capability, Radio Frequency-enabled devices significantly increase vulnerability and risk. Cyber and physical security strategies must now include components that address threats from RF-enabled devices.
DGS CLEARSKY™ provides anomalous signal detection and multiple geolocation techniques for any signal of interest in the 70 MHz to 6 GHz range. Anomalous signals include:
- Unintentional interference
- Intentional signal interruption (jamming)
- Communications devices encroaching on a protected area
- UAVs (aka "drones")

Fernando Murias, Chairman and CEO of DGS, stated, "We recognize Indra as a global leader in the defense industry. They are rigorous about selecting components for CROW and we are thrilled to be included in this leading-edge solution for drone threat management."
CLEARSKY™ combines machine learning and a real-time analysis of signal characteristics to rapidly detect drones and other anomalous activity without the reliance on a library of known drone signals. Additionally, CLEARSKY™ is frequency agnostic, meaning a transmissions can be detected and classified outside of frequency bands where drones typically operate. This ensures that drones that have been modified to operate outside the regulated frequencies can be detected.
About DGS Founded in 2013 and headquartered in northern Virginia, DGS blends broad experience and deep expertise in the fields of telecommunications, critical infrastructure protection, and defense. DGS has been awarded approximately 100 patents with 25 patents pending for the advancement of spectrum monitoring and RF data management, enabling the capture and analysis of wideband spectrum data at the point of intercept for applications that deliver real-time situational awareness.

Full text: Dynamic winemaking, a wide variety of wine styles, positive quality-to-value perception and focus on sustainable and organic wine production rank highest
NEW YORK, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- According to a recent survey of 369 U.S. qualified retailers, beverage directors and importers by research provider Wine Opinions, Languedoc is a region to watch with a "dynamic generation" that values sustainable and organic wine production. Survey respondents also highlighted the Languedoc region's wide variety of wines and wine styles and outstanding quality-to-value as key selling points.
The survey was commissioned by the Conseil Interprofessionnel des Vins du Languedoc (CIVL) to identify current perceptions of the historic region in the south of France, which encompasses 90,000 acres of vines and 22,000 winemakers and négociants. "Human enterprise is the foremost asset of our wine region," shares Olivier Legrand, Director of Vins du Languedoc. "We are delighted that U.S. trade respondents recognize the efforts of the dynamic generation hard at work to shape the future of our wines, as well as the sheer variety of styles our winegrowers strive for in Languedoc. We're proud to be one of the leading organic wine regions in the world and appreciate that our significant environmental commitment and collective investment are highly valued by trade partners."
As reported by Wine Opinions, respondents were asked to review a series of statements about Vins du Languedoc, and rate each for its potential to generate purchase interest in Languedoc wines. The following statements received the highest collective ratings by all respondents:
- A dynamic generation of Languedoc winemakers are driving quality and sustainability higher: 74% of respondents ranked this statement as a top qualifier of success for Languedoc. 33% of France's certified organic vineyards are in Languedoc and Roussillon, the highest of any French wine area.
- Languedoc can produce Rhône-style blends, fresh light whites, and a variety of rosé wines at better value for the price than other regions: 77% of respondents responded positively to this statement, indicating that a wide variety of styles from the region's 20 AOPs deliver noteworthy quality-to-value.
- There has been tremendous improvement in Languedoc wines over the past decades in terms of style, quality, and new appellations: 75% of respondents responded positively to this statement. 9 of the Languedoc region's 20 AOPs are less than 20 years old, a quality standard that has been well-received by the trade.

Conseil Interprofessionnel des Vins du Languedoc (CIVL), the governing body that represents the region's winemakers, merchants, and brokers, commissioned the recent trade survey as part of their continuing support of the U.S. market. The CIVL aims to expand awareness of the southern French region with trade, media and consumers through multiple tactics such as PR outreach and sampling; digital discovery campaigns; winemaker tours; and a dedicated trade education program to support new and existing partners looking to expand sales and distribution of Languedoc wines.
As of year-end 2021, the U.S. was the leading export market for Vins du Languedoc, both in volume and value. Media and trade who are interested in receiving news and updates from Vins du Languedoc are invited to contact Claire Martin (claire@gregoryvine.com) and Katie Keith (katie@gregoryvine.com).
About Wine Opinions Survey Protocol
All results of the 2022 Vins du Languedoc U.S. Trade Survey were conducted by Wine Opinions, the leading research provider to the U.S. wine industry. There were 369 survey respondents. Results were calculated at a confidence level of 90%. Confidence intervals for the total sample were ± 2.6% to ± 4.3%. Reporting is based on analysis and comparisons of relevant tiers of the trade.

Established in 1994, CIVL acts as a central authority with oversight over the region's grape-growing and winemaking business in four central areas, namely (1) promotion, PR and marketing campaigns to expand brand awareness; (2) business development and market research; (3) quality control and assurance in national and global markets; and (4) research and development in cooperation with the French Vineyard & Wine Institute (IFV), including best practices that benefit all Languedoc AOPs (such as climate change protocols, water conservation and sustainable initiatives).

Full text: Foundational for curating Data Products, new metadata and schema capabilities reduce time to discovery from hours to seconds
BOSTON, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today at Amazon Web Services (AWS) re:Invent, Starburst , the analytics anywhere company, announced the launch of foundational Data Products capabilities for its managed service, Starburst Galaxy. New data and schema discovery and data privileges capabilities simplify and streamline the traditional Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process for the curation of Data Products, accelerating data querying, access and analytics across the organization. The foundational Data Products capabilities are now available in public preview.
Data volumes and use are exploding across industries. Connected internet of things (IoT) devices are expected to generate almost 80B zettabytes (ZB) of data by 2025 and organizations are inheriting data through M&A and newly developed applications at a fast pace. Regardless of intention, nearly every modern enterprise is or will be driven to the cloud as a result.
While data lakes and data warehouses have been effective in solving many data management challenges, the cloud is still becoming everyone's reality and data use is continuing to explode. In turn, these data lakes and warehouses can quickly become data swamps – murky or cluttered with disorganized data that presents significant challenges around accessibility and the ability to leverage the data for actionable insights. Delivered as a managed service through Starburst Galaxy, these new discoverability features are addressing these challenges, reducing time to discovery from hours to seconds, and laying the foundation for self-service Data Product curation, regardless of technical expertise. New capabilities include:
- Data discovery enables data users to easily search and understand what data they have, where it lives, and where it came from. Metadata is automatically populated with query history and context, providing key insights into how data is being used.
- Schema discovery takes this a step further by enabling the discovery of not just existing datasets across sources and clouds, but also net new datasets, no matter what form they're in. This takes the "Transform" out of "ELT," supporting a more simplified process where data engineers loading data don't need to consider the schemas beforehand.
- Granular Access Control enables data administrators to clearly see and understand who has access to what data, and how it's being used, in the context of the data itself. This means data administrators can monitor and change permissions through policy as code to ensure security and risk reduction within a continuous integration / continuous delivery / continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

"Data volumes are growing exponentially and simultaneously becoming more distributed, which makes finding, managing, and curating datasets a highly time-consuming, resource-intensive process," said Justin Borgman, Chairman & CEO, Starburst. "New discoverability capabilities in Starburst Galaxy empower organizations to find and understand data before querying, laying the foundation for Data Product curation by streamlining data discovery and accelerating ELT processes. Enabling organizations to more efficiently discover the right datasets, Starburst Galaxy is helping reduce costs while getting more value out of their data."
This Data Products update to Starburst Galaxy comes shortly after Starburst announced enhanced Data Products functionality for its flagship product, Starburst Enterprise. It also comes on the heels of a big year for Starburst's software-as-a-service (SaaS) product where it enhanced its distributed data analytics capabilities and, less than a year after its introduction, closed its first-ever seven-figure customer deal. While enabling data producers and consumers to create, publish, discover, and manage curated Data Products is core to the emerging Data Mesh paradigm focused on decentralization and self-service, Starburst remains steadfast in its commitment to realizing the Data Mesh vision.

Full text: Media Inquiries: Christian Habermann MayaMD | CMO 617.990.7745 Christian@mayamd.ai
"This is an incredible honor and we are thrilled to be chosen from such a large competitive pool of amazing digital healthcare companies," Dr. Vipindas Chengat, founder of MayaMD.
LAS VEGAS, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- MayaMD was selected as a finalist in this year's UCSF Health Hub's digital healthcare awards in their Rising Star category for saving patient costs. This annual digital healthcare awards competition, held at HLTH, is a competitive field of hundreds of top startups and has become a who's who of the innovative world of digital healthcare.
Patient costs have been rising annually at an alarming rate for years, making medical debt an enormous issue. With over 60% of the US adult population with one chronic condition and 40% with two or more, managing these conditions is extremely difficult for patients alone without their high medical cost. 90% of our nation's $4.1 trillion in annual healthcare cost are attributable to patients with chronic and mental health conditions (Rand & CMS).
Thankfully, digital healthcare solutions have ushered in a new era of innovative ways to combat this. MayaMD's AI healthcare platform helps to enable value-based care. Value based healthcare is the real future of healthcare in our country, as the industry transitions from fee for service to this new model. It's also without a doubt the biggest challenge in our healthcare industry, as providers find this change so challenging.
MayaMD is taking a bite out of costs by helping patients with multiple chronic diseases better manage their healthcare. Working directly with some of the largest kidney providers in the country, MayaMD employs its state-of-the-art remote patient monitoring platform that uses AI to provide clinical insights, which helps to provide more precise care for each patient's needs. According to the CDC, kidney disease affects an estimated 37 million people in the U.S. (15% of the adult population; more than 1 in 7 adults). Approximately 90% of those with kidney disease don't know they have it, and a surprising 2 out of 5 adults with severe kidney disease don't know they have it. 1 in 3 adults in the U.S. (approximately 80 million) is at risk for kidney disease. The top two causes for chronic kidney disease are diabetes and high blood pressure.
To give an idea of how costly this disease is, in 2018, Medicare costs for all people with all stages of kidney disease was $130 billion. In 2018, Medicare spent $81 billion for people with kidney disease and an additional $49.2 billion for people with kidney failure replacement treatment. Dialysis treatment is the most common for CKD, which costs our Medicare system an average of $90,000 per patient annually. The other option is a kidney transplant, which is less than half the cost, but the wait is long as demand outstrips supply.
Early detection of kidney disease could save a substantial percentage of these costs, as well as a healthier diet, exercise and taking medication on time. MayaMD's platform helps to support all of these by appropriately assessing each patient's personal needs. For example, a patient with CKD stage 1 will need a different regimen than a patient with CKD 3 or 4. MayaMD's artificial intelligence takes a holistic and deep look at each patient by evaluating all of their healthcare data. MayaMD's clinical engine or brain uses millions of data relations that have been designed and optimized over the years, with help from some of the best researchers and medical faculty from some of the most prestigious medical universities, to allow it to offer providers and patients actionable care data. In today's data world, the advantage goes to the ones who have the best data, as well as what it particularly means for them.
While it's not possible to reverse kidney damage, you can take steps to slow it down. Taking prescribed medicine, being physically active, and eating well will help. MayaMD's chronic care programs are designed to help manage these important items for patients while also tracking important patient vitals like blood pressure and weight.

CHICAGO, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Polaris Group, a leading post-acute healthcare consulting and staffing company, launches Polaris Edge to help communities navigate ongoing regulatory changes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).
"Polaris Edge is your year-long Medicare and clinical compliance roadmap based on 35+ years of expertise." Polaris Edge is a suite of year-long, customizable consulting programs designed to enhance nursing home compliance and financial oversight. Polaris Edge comes at a critical moment in long-term care recovery.
"Facilities can't provide high quality care without financial resources and well-trained teams. But the sad reality is that many communities have been operating in the red for over 18 months. They're struggling to keep up with policy changes. Operators are experiencing a financial, compliance, and staff morale crisis," explained Polaris Group's Director of Consulting Services Wendy Strain.
"Long-term care communities need consistent support to fix their operations now and to prepare for a wave of policy changes."
Polaris Edge: future-proofing facilities with custom Medicare accuracy and compliance support
In 2022 alone, CMS announced a new Prospective Payment Final Rule, released additional surveyor guidance on the Rules of Participation Phase III, and shared a new draft of the Minimum Data Set (MDS) Assessment.
These regulations impact reimbursement rates, compliance requirements, and a facility's Five-Star Quality Rating, or consumer-facing review. Facilities will be grappling with these changes and feeling their effects in 2023 and beyond.
Polaris Edge arms facilities with the tools and ongoing support to improve operational performance today and navigate ongoing CMS changes.
What Polaris Edge includes:
Polaris Edge programs are year-long, data-driven, and flexible to community needs. Each program begins with an audit or mock survey to establish baseline performance. Using the baseline results, Polaris consultants create and deliver custom departmental trainings. They also provide ongoing monthly reviews to track improvement and provide guidance on persistent issues.  
A closer look at Polaris Edge programs:
Polaris Edge - Medicare Compliance & Accuracy: get accurately reimbursed for the care you provide
What it includes:

- 4-Day MCOA or 2-Day PDPM Audit
- Onsite or Remote Facility Training
- Monthly Claim Audits


Polaris Edge- Clinical Compliance: avoid citations and improve your Five-Star Quality Rating
What it includes:

- 4-Day Onsite Mock Survey
- Onsite or Remote Facility Training
- Monthly Chart Audits


"Now is the time to get your operations in order. Polaris Edge is that year-long roadmap based on 35+ years of Medicare and state survey expertise. It's a game changer for facilities looking for long-term strategies and sustainable results," shared Strain.

Info Tech's Data Quadrant Report provides a comprehensive evaluation of leading solutions in workforce management – for the enterprise market with WorkForce Software ranking in the highest position and winning a Data Quadrant Gold Medal in the Workforce Management - Enterprise (WFM) Software Awards category.
The SoftwareReviews Data Quadrant evaluates and ranks products based on feedback from information technology (IT) and business professionals. The data is verified for accuracy, analyzed, and categorized in easy-to-visualize charts.

Businesses that are committed to connecting with their employees and optimizing productivity are investing in modern workforce management solutions. Modern workforce management enables business leaders to forecast labor requirements, optimize staff scheduling, track time and attendance for accurate pay, gather valuable employee feedback in the flow of work, consistently communicate with and among employees, engage employees with needed training, and more.
"It's gratifying for our employees to see their hard work and commitment pay off after being named the leader in the Workforce Management Enterprise Data Quadrant for the fifth consecutive year.

Full text: Native cloud platform connectors and system integrator alignment help data teams deliver business-ready data faster
DENVER and MANCHESTER, England, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Matillion , the leader in data productivity, today announced technical and cloud ecosystem partnerships to accelerate the value of data within enterprises.
Varying skill levels, competing protocols, and a mix of processes and platforms keep modern data teams from delivering what the business needs. Seventy-five percent of data teams believe that outdated migration and maintenance processes are costing their organizations time, productivity, and money — at an annual price tag of up to $43.5 million.
The Data Productivity Cloud is a data integration platform that allows teams of all skill levels to deliver business-ready data through cloud-native ELT (data extract, load, and transform).
"Enterprises on a cloud data modernization journey need to prioritize a data stack that works in harmony with other platforms to achieve rapid time to value and trusted insights. The Data Productivity Cloud is a stack-ready platform that integrates with the platforms we need to deliver business-ready data to improve customer experience," said Harveer Singh, chief data architect and head of data at Western Union. "We use Matillion to load, transform, synchronize and orchestrate our data to produce a single source of truth in our data warehouse and connect to various business intelligence tools."
Data teams improve efficiency using Matillion Data Productivity Cloud and these integrated accelerators:
- Healthcare Data Integration in Snowflake : FHIR Data Loader powered by Matillion and Hakkōda is a low-code solution that makes it easier for healthcare data teams to load FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data in Snowflake, then transform the data into a fully structured format for more accessible analytics.
- AWS Redshift Serverless Scale : allows customers to easily run and scale analytics without provisioning and managing data warehouse clusters. Matillion users can choose Redshift Serverless agent from the drop-down menu inside Matillion ETL to scale data analytics.
- AllCloud's Matillion One Click solution : accelerates customers' journey to the cloud for data analytics by automating the setup and maintenance of data pipelines, monitoring costs and performance, and managing upgrades and disaster recovery, reducing deployment time by 75%.
- Collibra integration for end-to-end data lineage : as Collibra's Rising Star Partner of the Year 2022, Matillion integrates with Collibra to create unified data lineage that maps inbound and outbound data flows and stitches data objects to existing assets in the Collibra data catalog.

"Working with FHIR data has become necessary for healthcare data teams. This dynamic and private data needs to be integrated for analytics but proves difficult to manage for legacy or point solution data platforms," said Patrick Buell, VP of consulting and co-founder at Hakkōda. "With Matillion's Data Productivity Cloud and Hakkōda's FHIR Starter accelerator, healthcare data professionals can load and transform FHIR data into Snowflake for faster time to insights. Solutions which used to require very senior expertise are now as easy as drag and drop."
"The Data Productivity Cloud enables teams to get the most out of their data infrastructure, using native integrations and low maintenance connectors to help enterprises use more of their data and put it to work," said Josh Lewis, VP of global channels and alliances at Matillion. "We are proud to partner with leading cloud technology providers and system integrators that put the customer at the center of their innovations and support data teams to deliver insights quickly."

Full text: New assay measures lentiviral vector transduction efficiency in days
AVROBIO to present data on the transduction assay at 4 th Annual Gene Therapy Analytical Development Summit
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Mission Bio, the pioneer in high-throughput single-cell DNA and multi-omics analysis, announced the first-time deployment of one single-cell transduction assay across gene therapy company AVROBIO's lysosomal disorder pipeline. The two companies collaborated to develop a precise, reproducible assay using Mission Bio's Tapestri® Platform to rapidly measure the percentage of transduced cells in samples composed of thousands of cells. AVROBIO is presenting data today on the use of this assay to determine percent transduction in autologous, lentiviral vector-mediated, genetically modified drug product at the 4th Annual Gene Therapy Analytical Development (GTAD) Summit.
Transduction percentage is a critical quality attribute for cell and gene therapy manufacturing, measuring the successful transduction of therapeutic genes into target cells. Assessing this in thousands of cells with the previous percent transduction assay could take months, starting with a protracted cell growth step before performing PCR-based measurements on each single colony. But with the Tapestri®-based assay, AVROBIO's scientists can analyze thousands of single cells without a clonal outgrowth step, increasing throughput and precision.
In February 2022, Mission Bio transferred the new percent transduction assay to AVROBIO's contract research organization (CRO) partner for qualification and adoption in a current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) setting, with the aim of replacing the previous assay for lot release. AVROBIO expects to begin testing clinical samples with the new assay in early 2023 and include it as part of future regulatory filings, including Investigational New Drug (IND) submissions.
"The Tapestri®-based percent transduction assay has become an important tool providing us with the ability to rapidly and precisely measure critical quality attributes like percent transduced cells in drug product, and we believe this helps with demonstrating manufacturing capability and consistency," said Azadeh Golipour, Ph.D., Chief Technology Officer at AVROBIO. "Because we developed the assay agnostic to particular drug products, we can integrate it across multiple programs in our pipeline. We believe utilizing platform analytics across the entire portfolio reduces the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) development timeline and allows us to deliver potentially life-changing therapies to patients with lysosomal disorders."
"The output of this collaboration with AVROBIO marks an important milestone, as we work to demonstrate the utility of single-cell multi-omic assays for therapeutic development and clinical testing," said Yan Zhang, Ph.D., CEO of Mission Bio. "Regulators and drug developers are demanding better ways of measuring various genomic attributes in a GMP environment to ensure safety and efficacy as cell and gene therapies progress through the clinic."
In a single high-throughput assay developed with the Tapestri® Platform, Mission Bio's biopharma partners can assess multiple characteristics of single gene-modified cells, including transduction efficiency, vector copy number, on- and off-target genome edits, zygosity, and aberrant translocations.
Dwayne Neal, Senior Director, Analytical Sciences & Technology, at AVROBIO, will share usage details and data on the assay in a talk titled "Single-Cell Genomics & NGS to Determine Percentage Transduction in Autologous Lentiviral Vector Drug Product." The presentation will be held in-person only as part of the GTAD Summit's Molecular Biology track on Nov. 29 at noon ET.

Full text: Level 4 Press presents a romantic and hilarious trip to Napa Valley.
JAMUL, Calif., Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Authors Addison J. Chapple and Victoria Bay write a romantic comedy called Rambling with Rebah (NOV 2022), about two former enemies who have lost their lust for life. Set in the heart of wine country, these adversaries find that their pitched battle over a Bed and Breakfast blog review is just the thing they needed to reconnect with love, life, and each other.
Romantic comedies like Rambling with Rebah are reminders that adventure and the euphoric feeling of falling in love can happen at any moment in your life. B&B owner Aiden has just gone through the motions for years, only holding on enough to care for his teenage daughter. Travel blogger Rebah has lost herself in her career, leaving no room for meaningful relationships. But even if Aiden and Rebah have disconnected from the joyful lives they once lived, the door to it never closed.
"It's easy to lose yourself and fall behind," Addison J. Chapple says. This novel was inspired by the idea of second chances and finding love even when you thought it was too late. When life feels like it has lost its sparkle, the romantic adventure of  Rambling with Rebah  sweeps you away and reignites it. 
Things haven't been easy for Aiden Cisneros. His beloved wife passed away 5 years ago, and their Happy Valley Bed and Breakfast has been falling apart ever since. With his daughter getting ready to move away to college, Aiden is finally ready to sell and move on. There's just one problem . . . And her name is Rebah Reynolds.
Rebah is a travel blogger with millions of followers, but travel has lost its allure for Rebah, and now it's just a paycheck. In a drunken fury, she gave Aiden's B&B a disastrous review. So, the last thing she ever expected was for him to call and request another chance.
Struggling to keep up with her younger competition, Rebah agrees and heads out to Napa to craft a scathing critique to satisfy modern audiences. Aiden, however, has cooked up a wild scheme to guarantee a great review and close his sale. Something funny happens when you're surrounded by the romantic hills of wine country . . .
Rambling with Rebah by Addison J. Chapple and Victoria Bay is a celebration of love and second chances.

https://dam.gettyimages.com/assignments/with-love-halston-event-hosted-by-istituto-marango
The paparazzi section buzzed with stars, fashion executives, and designers in celebration of the night's festivities. Special guests included Halston's Niece and Founder of With Love Halston: Lesley Frowick ; With Love Halston Co-Founder, Steve Gold ; Halston Creative Director: Ken Downing ; Istituto Marangoni Miami CEO: Hakan Bakyam ; Illustrator for Halston and Ralph Lauren: Audrey Schilt ; Miami Housewives: Kiki Barth . The event emcee was former Editor-in-Chief of Vogue Mexico, Eva Hughes .
"It takes courage, perseverance, and a little madness to make it in this industry. Halston had this. He was courageous and extreme in his own, minimalistic way," said IMM's founder and president Hakan Baykam. "We are excited to be collaborating with With Love Halston. Students need to challenge themselves and participate in contests like this one. It's a tough industry and they need to be persistent – just like Halston."
Student Winner Announced The winner of the With Love Halston student design contest was Ryan Anthony Hamilton who created a Halston inspired jumpsuit with splatter paint design.  Second place was Valentina Arenas, and third place was Camila Balleste. The contest gave students, which were narrowed down to eight finalists, hands-on experience and insights into Halston's talents and style. The competition used five-point criteria including the requirement that Ultrasuede, the fabric synonymous with his work, be used. Participants created inspiration boards, paper sketches, selected fabric swatches, and showed designs with front and back views.
"My uncle was a visionary. He would be proud if he were here to witness these talented eight Marangoni Miami finalists," said Lesley Frowick, Halston's Niece and founder of the non-profit With Love Halston.
Student finalists were Marissa Mercado, Maria Cacciatore, Ryan Anthony Hamilton, Jose Angel Costa, Paola Pueyo, Vanessa Lubeigt, Valentina Arenas, Camila Balleste, Veronica Scutaro and Nicole Leave.
Fashion Activations The DJ spun music evocative of disco's heyday, creating a retro ambiance as guests sipped Prosecco from Valdo. The evening's events included a fashion show of the students' Halston inspired designs. A dramatic innovation included 3D Avatars of the models, a technique that is paving the way for an eco-friendlier way of creating samples and fashion design and is at the cutting edge of fashion technology.  In real time, illustrator Audrey Schilt, Creative Director of WLH, created drawings that were auctioned and then personalized. There was also a raffle of 38 posters with illustrations by various artists from the FIDA organization led by our partner Patrick Morgan.
Giving Thanks The already jubilant mood of the room continued to build as Hakan Baykam, Lesley Frowick, and Steve Gold, Managing Director of WLH shared gratitude and substantive messages for those that participated in various elements of the event including: Patrick Morgan MA RCA for the design of the invitation and posters, Scott Vogel CPA for WLH, Rigaud, The Nando and Elsa Peretti Foundation, Tiffany & Co,  Toray/Ultrasuede, The Do-Gooders, HALSTON/Excel Brands, FIDA Worldwide, Amy Berkowitz and Mario Braghieri professors and mentors at Istituto Marangoni Miami.

Full text: This course, available as one-credit-hour of Continuing Medical Education (CME) for physicians and a 45-minute webinar for non-physicians (other healthcare professionals, coaches, parents, educators, and advocates), focuses on a patient-centered approach to concussion care and speaks to this injury's significant mental health component
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Concussion Alliance's course (and webinar for non-physicians) is the most comprehensive CME on concussions  and is ideal for physicians needing to meet CME requirements for the end of the year. Its unique format combines perspectives from brain injury medicine physiatrist Elizabeth Sandel, MD , and persistent post-concussion symptom patient Conor Gormally . It provides critical information and insights for healthcare providers in primary care, emergency medicine, neurology, physiatry, sports medicine, and more.
The video-and-slide course offered by Med Learning Group, "A Patient-Centered Approach to Concussion Care for Emergency Medicine and Primary Care Physicians," contains up-to-date information on concussion research, best practices, specialty care referrals, and tools for evaluating and treating patients with acute and chronic symptoms, including a discussion of the prevalence of mental health disorders following a concussion.
Interspersed with Dr. Sandel's recommendations is the compelling story of Gormally, 25, who articulates the challenges of living with multiple concussions. Gormally discusses the physical, mental, and emotional impacts of a concussion and chronic symptoms–along with his struggles learning how to advocate for school accommodations and effective healthcare.
Coaches, athletic trainers, athletes, patients, and parents accessing the non-CME webinar  will appreciate the clear explanations of the injury, best practices to promote recovery, and information about multidisciplinary care for persistent symptoms.
"This compelling AMA Category 1 free CME juxtaposes Dr. Elizabeth Sandel, an expert physiatrist in concussion care, with Conor Gormally, an articulate young man who shares his personal journey and perspectives on rehabilitation from concussion, including a critical perspective on mental health considerations post-injury. It's the closest thing to the 'live patient Grand Rounds experience' in the post-COVID space and keeps the pacing of the hour fresh."
Susan Klein, MD
Pediatric Neurologist
"After viewing the webinar, my understanding of concussion and its immediate and long-term symptoms was much clearer. As a rugby coach and referee, it's a great tool to educate myself and colleagues about the subject in accessible terms. The importance of aftercare, both physically and, more importantly, mentally and socially is now at the forefront of my priorities to player safety and development."
Graham Oliver
RFU coach level 1
Grassroots Rugby, UK

Full text: New engines are more fuel efficient and less expensive to operate than previous models
LONGUEUIL, QC, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pratt & Whitney, a Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: RTX) business, ATR and Air Corsica today celebrated the delivery of the first PW127XT-M-powered next generation of ATR 72-600 aircraft. The debut of the upgraded PW127XT engine series, which will be the standard powerplant for all ATR42/72-600s, delivers significant improvement in operating costs, maintenance, and sustainability for regional turboprops.
Pratt & Whitney Canada has also signed a customized 15-year Fleet Management™ Program (FMP™) agreement with the airline for the long-term maintenance of the PW127XT-M engines, which provides predictable, pay-per-hour engine maintenance, lower operating costs, and maximized engine value by unlocking its full time on wing capability.
"Our relationship with Pratt & Whitney Canada goes back more than three decades, when Air Corsica launched inaugural service with an all-ATR fleet in 1990 equipped with Pratt & Whitney Canada's PW100 engines," said Hervé Pierret, Member of Management Board, Air Corsica. "We have seen great success with these dependable engines that allow our airframe to accommodate the challenges of flying short legs all year long, and connecting our island communities to mainland. The flexibility of the new fleet of ATR aircraft, powered by the versatile PW127XT-M engines and optimized with the Fleet Management™ Program, will allow us to sustainably grow and prosper over the decades to come."
Revealed at the Dubai Airshow in November 2021 and certified by Transport Canada Civil Aviation in August of 2022, the PW127XT engine series is the new standard in global regional turboprop aviation. It delivers 3% greater fuel efficiency on top of Pratt & Whitney Canada's PW100 turboprop engine family, which already provides 40% greater fuel efficiency and related emissions compared to regional jets on the typical missions they fly.
"This was a highly efficient development, certification, and entry-into-service process achieved in close collaboration with ATR. We offer our congratulations to both Air Corsica and ATR on this significant milestone," said Irene Makris, vice president, Customer Service, Pratt & Whitney Canada. This FMP™ agreement is indicative of our long-standing commitment to service excellence through an engine-maintenance solution that will provide Air Corsica 15 years of cost protection for their specific business and investment, so they can focus on serving their customers."

Full text: Metaverse tools and services innovator adds new Chief Financial Officer and Chief Marketing Officer to continue impressive growth trajectory
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Infinite Reality  (iR), the Metaverse entertainment and innovation company, has expanded its senior leadership team with two industry veterans. Jason Eustace joins iR as Chief Financial Officer and Hope Frank will serve as the company's first Chief Marketing Officer.
These appointments to the Infinite Reality C-Suite continue the momentum of iR's impressive growth following on several recent key announcements, including:
- a game-changing new partnership with Warner Bros. and Discovery Sports Europe where iR is named Discovery Sports Events' exclusive Metaverse partner;
- a keynote speech by CEO John Acunto at the prestigious Web Summit 2022 in Lisbon;
- significant traction in Europe, including the signing of a strategic relationship to develop a global, open Metaverse hub with the University of Luxembourg's Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT); and
- a recent preview of a revolutionary new esports Metaverse product at this year's Esports Business Summit, the leading esports industry conference.

For brands looking to mold the future of audience engagement, iR makes unlimited social and commercial opportunities in the Metaverse possible, delivering the ultimate consumer and fan experiences.
"This expansion of Infinite Reality's executive team provides a significant boost to our global strategic objective to serve as the leader in innovation and production of immersive digital environments," said Infinite Reality CEO John Acunto. "Given our aggressive growth plan, we need a CFO like Jason Eustace with his years of experience in integrating brands, assets, and personnel. And obviously, Hope Frank fills the critical slot in our team for a marketing visionary as we put iR center stage with the world's largest sports and entertainment partners and venues."
Growing the C-Suite Highly-respected financial executive Jason Eustace now serves as Infinite Reality's Chief Financial Officer, joining the company earlier this year. In this role, Jason is responsible for developing and managing financial strategy and the expansion of iR's growing portfolio, including the recent close of the company's $470 million acquisition of esports and entertainment conglomerate ReKTGlobal. With 25 years in financial and business planning and analysis, Jason brings strong vision and a proven ability to drive top-line growth and profitability and lead successful post-merger integrations in both private and publicly traded companies. Jason has an industry-leading record of success in his previous roles with multiple global media, e-commerce, and retail entities, including more than ten years with Discovery Communications and seven years with the National Geographic Channel. His proven skill set of driving organizational effectiveness and the implementation of critical strategic initiatives has served him in financial leadership positions in companies including Curiosity Stream, Bluemercury (a Macy's company), PetSmart, and RealNetworks.
"With my background of integrating entities within media, retail, and e-commerce companies, Infinite Reality is the perfect fit for me," said Jason Eustace. "It's been a thrill ride to close a half-billion-dollar acquisition so soon after joining the team. I can't wait to see what's around the corner for us in 2023 as we continue to establish the company firmly with new global partners to empower their digital entertainment, esports, and retail experiences."
Hope Frank will lead the critical tasks of planning, developing, and executing Infinite Reality's brand, innovation, and marketing strategy worldwide. In her award-winning 20-plus year career, Hope has led IPOs and strategic exits for some of the fastest-growing technology companies in Silicon Valley. She drove marketing initiatives for multiple B2B and B2C companies including streaming juggernaut Conviva, Webtrends, and SBC. Hope was responsible for the launch of Starbucks WiFi, ESPN HD, and led digital and analytics partner programs with AEG and Facebook. Most recently, she served as global CMO for virtual science laboratory eduverse company Labster. Hope's additional professional achievements include being a Netflix documentary filmmaker and producer. She is a member of the executive Board of Directors for influencer marketing behemoth Influential, a founding member of the CMO Club, and sits on the advisory board of the CMO Council and BlueTech Research.
"It's extraordinary to have the opportunity to join Infinite Reality at this pivotal juncture in our explosive growth," said Hope Frank. "I look forward to extending our brand's impact as an enabler and builder of an open Metaverse that delivers jaw-dropping, premium, immersive experiences for retail, education, sports, and entertainment."

Full text: Revolutionary solution treats the appearance of "tired" or "sleepy" eyes
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Aesthetic IQ Clinic is now offering Upneeq treatments at its Scottsdale location. Upneeq, the only FDA-approved prescription eye drops of its kind, is used by clients who have developed ptosis, or low-lying lids, to elevate the upper eyelids and open up the eyes for a more rejuvenated appearance.
"This product has been a game changer for many of my patients, myself included! For those of us with heavier upper eyelid anatomy, one drop of Upneeq in each eye helps brighten up the face and make patients look less tired," said Marissa Abdo, MS, RN, CANS, Aesthetic IQ Founder.
Upneeq is used to correct the appearance of acquired blepharoptosis, which causes low-lying or heavy eyelids. Clients who are considering upper eyelid surgery to open their eyes and brighten them but are put off by the exorbitant surgical expenses frequently prefer this solution. It is an excellent, low-cost alternative to eyelid surgery that produces the same benefits with minimal downtime.
The product is incredibly versatile and can be used for daily use, special events, or when you know you'll be photographed and want to appear brighter and more alert. Results can be seen in just 15 minutes of application and last up to 8 hours.
Users are often pleasantly surprised by how much more brilliant and livelier their eyes appear after using Upneeq. According to Abdo, the majority of her patients who sample the eyedrop on one eye in the office and compare it to the untreated eye after 15 minutes are completely blown away by the difference.
"I even have some patients with natural asymmetric eyelid ptosis (one eye droopier than another) that use the drop in the affected eye to look more symmetric. It only lasts 8 hours and they come individually packaged which makes it super easy to travel with too. It's always in my carry-on bag and purse!" said Abdo.
For a limited time, the clinic is offering a free Upneeq treatment to any patient who allows the clinic to share their before and after photos on social media.
For additional information, phone 480.454.5577, go to AestheticIQClinic.com, or visit 7054 E Cochise Rd. B200 Scottsdale, AZ 85253. You can follow the clinic on social media at @Marissa.AestheticIQ.

Full text: LONDON and BRUSSELS, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Keystone Strategy LLC (Keystone), a consultancy to top technology companies, government agencies and global law firms on strategy, economics, technology, and competition, today announced that Andrea Coscelli would join as Partner and Co-Head of the European Practice on 3 January 2023.
Dr Coscelli, a leading European expert in antitrust and competition economics, was CEO of the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for six years till last July. He will co-lead the firm's European expansion with Cristina Caffarra, who set up Keystone's operations in Europe earlier this year with full-service antitrust, economics and technology advice.
Keystone was founded by Greg Richards and Professor Marco Iansiti in 2003 and is one of the world's most prominent advisors to the technology sector, building deep expertise by handling high-profile cases with a specific focus on the digital economy. Keystone's affiliates are all top academic experts on digital transformation, innovation, platform economics, computer science, strategic management, and ecosystems, supported by 150 professionals across its US and London offices.
Dr Coscelli brings twenty-five years of competition economics experience.  He led the CMA between 2016 and 2022 during a period of significant growth following the UK exit from the EU. Under his leadership, the agency built pioneering data and technology capabilities, now being adopted by other leading agencies, and worked on many high-profile global mergers and antitrust cases involving digital businesses. Before joining the CMA as an executive board member in 2013, Dr Coscelli was a Director of Competition Economics at Ofcom (UK Media and Telecom regulator) and a partner at Charles River Associates. He has a PhD in Economics from Stanford University.
Andrea Coscelli said: "I look forward to joining Cristina and my new colleagues at Keystone. Agencies like the CMA are increasingly combining legal and economic expertise with technology, data, computer science and strategy capabilities in their investigations in the digital sector. I believe combining deep antitrust economics expertise with insights from data science and an understanding of firms' strategies is increasingly essential. I believe Keystone's unique combined offering will allow us to generate high-quality and highly relevant advice."
Cristina Caffarra said "It is exciting to work together with Andrea – a former colleague and then the leader of a pioneering agency, who has moved the dial more than most on enforcement priorities. Andrea and I share the same vision on the need to update traditional antitrust advice with the integration of deep technology expertise and on the kind of advice which is most relevant and direct. I look forward to expanding Keystone together in Europe."
Greg Richards, CEO and Co-Founder of Keystone, said: "For two decades, Keystone has served global clients, including the largest technology companies, with counsel on matters involving strategy, litigation, regulation, and public policy. Now, with the EU and the UK becoming leading forces in antitrust and regulation of the digital sector, it is time to expand and bring the expertise we have built over the years to this important region. We are delighted that Andrea has agreed to join us to spearhead our expansion with Cristina. Andrea has an amazing track record in competition policy and will enable us to take Keystone's offering in Europe to a new level."
The new Keystone office in London will serve as the European headquarters for the firm. Although Keystone has served major technology clients in the European region for the last decade, the expanding team in London will help the firm play a key role in future competition, regulatory, and litigation matters while attracting more talent to the business.

Full text: Tetra Bio-Pharma Inc., Ms. Natalie Leroux, Phone: + 1 (833) 977-7575, Email: investors@tetrabiopharma.com, media@tetrabiopharma.com
- Tetra strengthens its intellectual property position with PCT and provisional patent applications for its innovative therapeutic, ARDS-003.

MONTREAL, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - Tetra Bio-Pharma Inc. ("Tetra" or the "Company") (TSX: TBP) (OTCQB: TBPMF) (FRA: JAM1), a leader in cannabinoid-derived drug discovery and development today announced the filing of three patent applications for its novel therapeutic, ARDS-003.
- The Company filed an international patent under PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) related to the methodology, including improvements, for the synthesis of target synthetic cannabinoid derivatives, specifically HU308 (known as Onternabez) and HU433. (Methods, Processes, and Compositions for Improved Preparation of HU308 and HU433 Application No. PCT/CA2021/051327)
- The Company filed an international PCT application related to the pharmaceutical methods of production and uses of the compositions comprising Onternabez, suitable for parenteral delivery. (Parenteral Cannabinoid Formulations and Uses Thereof Application No. PCT/CA2021/051882).
- The Company filed a provisional patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office related to crystalline Onternabez and uses thereof. This application covers identification of novel polymorphs and cocrystals of Onternabez, which will allow for extended patent protection on Onternabez and may lead to improvements in stability and solubility when formulating Onternabez for future drug products.
Guy Chamberland, CEO and Chief Regulatory Officer at Tetra commented "This is a significant step in protecting our novel therapeutic, ARDS-003. It is especially significant, considering the potential use of this novel cannabinoid molecule in antiviral and immunomodulator therapies. These patents would be enforceable once granted and provide additional protection to investors for up to 20 years from the filing date."
These three patent applications become part of Tetra's growing IP portfolio, which includes, 14 granted/issued patents, as well as one (1) provisional and five (5) PCT applications pending across international and national jurisdictions.
About ARDS-003 ARDS-003 is a novel First in Human (FIH) drug product containing the active pharmaceutical agent, Onternabez, a potent and selective full agonist of the type 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R), an essential immunomodulatory target. ARDS-003 is positioned to modulate acute systemic inflammation and prevent sepsis, ARDS, and organ damage.  While the clinical profile of ARDS arising from viral (COVID) or bacterial sepsis can vary, hyperinflammation involving a dysfunctional immune response is a common mediator of lung damage. Tetra's pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that ARDS-003 decreases this hyperinflammatory response and slows disease progression.
About Tetra Bio-Pharma Tetra Bio-Pharma (TSX: TBP) (OTCQB: TBPMF) (FRA:JAM1) is a leader in cannabinoid-derived drug discovery and development with a FDA and a Health Canada cleared clinical program aimed at bringing novel prescription drugs and treatments to patients and their healthcare providers. Their evidence-based scientific approach has enabled them to develop a pipeline of cannabinoid-based drug products for a range of medical conditions, including pain, inflammation, and oncology. With patients at the core of what they do, Tetra Bio-Pharma is focused on providing rigorous scientific validation and safety data required for inclusion into the existing biopharma industry by regulators, physicians and insurance companies.

RBC will purchase all of the existing preferred shares and subordinated debt of HSBC Canada held directly or indirectly by HSBC Holdings plc at par value.

Key performance and non-GAAP measures We use a variety of financial measures to evaluate our performance and the impact of the proposed transaction as described herein. In this press release we use certain key performance and non-GAAP measures, including forward-looking non-GAAP measures, that we believe provide useful information to investors. Readers are cautioned that key performance measures and non-GAAP measures, including EPS accretion and return on tangible common equity, do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by GAAP, and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other financial institutions.
Certain of the forward-looking estimated adjusted results presented in this document are based on analyst consensus estimates of RBC's future adjusted results as indicated, and we caution that the methodology applied by analysts to estimate those results may not be consistent with RBC's methodology. The forward-looking estimated results for HSBC Canada presented in this document are based on RBC management's estimate of HSBC Canada's future performance and we caution that these are preliminary estimates based on due diligence and management projections.
Caution regarding forward-looking statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of certain securities laws, including the "safe harbour" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and any applicable Canadian securities legislation, with respect to RBC's and HSBC Canada's financial performance, beliefs, plans, expectations, and estimates.

Full text: New Zealand announced last month a plan to begin taxing farmers for animal burps, a world-first move that has angered many farmers. Scientist and researcher Dr. John Jaquish discusses why this is ludicrous.
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Scientist, researcher, and bestselling author, Dr. John Jaquish wishes to go on record in the matter by saying the claim that burping cows are responsible for increasing planetary greenhouse gasses is 100% spectacularly false (Pure BS).
"ALL plant matter releases methane as it breaks down, therefore animal digestion has nothing to do with increased methane in the atmosphere," says Jaquish. "This reinforces the idea that methane is a naturally occurring gas and we shouldn't worry about naturally-created levels. Certain industries do create methane at a larger scale, and they, not the cows, must be the focus of discussions relating to environmental concerns."
Christine Baes, Professor in the Department of Animal Biosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, provides additional insight:
"The actual amount of methane released from a single blade of grass wouldn't change if it were just left to decompose, or if it were eaten by a cow and then digested by the bacteria in their gut. The only difference is that the methane would be released more quickly by a cow or other ruminants (animals that acquire nutrients from plant-based foods with the help of microorganisms)."
The precise amount of methane that different bacteria release (whether in a cow's digestive system, a person's digestive system, or in the field) is an area of ongoing research. Some scientists estimate that a single cow can emit up to 100 kg of methane per year and the 3.5 billion ruminants raised as livestock worldwide may generate about 6% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, (according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). This is a falsified number, as was shown in a 1995 study showing gas from cows is only totaling 2% over the next 50 to 100 years. (1)
Decomposing plants release methane, but no more or less than cows.

Full text: The Oregon College Savings Plan remains a strong option for investors with a silver status among national college savings plans and newly reduced fees
SALEM, Ore., Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Driven by a record-setting year of contributions and a strong fiscal position, the Oregon College Savings Plan (OCSP) has reduced its administrative fee by 20 percent. With the lower fee (from 0.25 to 0.20), Oregon families saving for college through OCSP can now expect to see a greater percentage of their contributions going toward future higher education expenses.
Ensuring that higher education is accessible and affordable for all families remains our top priority. Lower fees and a standout target enrollment investment series were key factors in solidifying OCSP's silver standing in Morningstar Inc.'s 2022 rankings of national college savings plans. Of the 14 plans singled out by Morningstar this year with a top-tier rating, OCSP is among the 12 plans ranked as silver. The continued focus on developing a high-quality and high-performing plan for savers, in combination with steady industry recognition, demonstrates that OCSP is delivering for its participants.
Plans are recognized based on Morningstar's confidence that their investment options will collectively outperform other plans and whether they exhibit a combination of attractive features, including: a well-researched asset-allocation approach, a robust process for selecting underlying investments, strong oversight from the state and investment manager, and low fees.
"Ensuring that higher education is accessible and affordable for all families remains our top priority. Lowering fees is an important step in making it easier for all Oregonians to be able to save for their higher education," said State Treasurer Tobias Read. "We are encouraged by this recognition from Morningstar, which acknowledges our work to enhance our savings options and lead in this space."
This latest fee reduction comes on the heels of an earlier decrease made possible by the transition to a new plan administrator in 2018. The move to Sumday Administration, now doing business as Vestwell State Savings, allowed OCSP to lower underlying fund fees for savers and offer an innovative program management fee structure.
As expected, this new fee structure, and the growth in assets under management, enabled this further fee reduction in 2022. Current OCSP savers now pay a low annual administrative fee of 0.20 percent of their total savings, and an annual investment fee (ranging from 0.02 percent to 0.45 percent of their total savings) based on the investment portfolios they've selected.
OCSP is acknowledged by Morningstar to have one of the most progressive investment structures in the industry, with a set of target investment options that allow savers to tailor investments and risk exposure based on the year the beneficiary is expected to enroll in higher education. This feature responds to the reality that not everybody moves directly to post-secondary education after high school.
The Oregon College Savings Plan  is a state-sponsored higher education savings program that comes with special tax advantages and can be opened by just about anyone.

CHICAGO, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Researchers have developed a deep learning model that uses a single chest X-ray to predict the 10-year risk of death from a heart attack or stroke, stemming from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Results of the study were presented today at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).
Deep learning is an advanced type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can be trained to search X-ray images to find patterns associated with disease.
"Our deep learning model offers a potential solution for population-based opportunistic screening of cardiovascular disease risk using existing chest X-ray images," said the study's lead author, Jakob Weiss, M.D., a radiologist affiliated with the Cardiovascular Imaging Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and the AI in Medicine program at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. "This type of screening could be used to identify individuals who would benefit from statin medication but are currently untreated."
Current guidelines recommend estimating 10-year risk of major adverse cardiovascular disease events to establish who should get a statin for primary prevention.
This risk is calculated using the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score, a statistical model that considers a host of variables, including age, sex, race, systolic blood pressure, hypertension treatment, smoking, Type 2 diabetes and blood tests. Statin medication is recommended for patients with a 10-year risk of 7.5% or higher.
"The variables necessary to calculate ASCVD risk are often not available, which makes approaches for population-based screening desirable," Dr. Weiss said. "As chest X-rays are commonly available, our approach may help identify individuals at high risk."
Dr. Weiss and a team of researchers trained a deep learning model using a single chest X-ray (CXR) input. They developed the model, known as CXR-CVD risk, to predict the risk of death from cardiovascular disease using 147,497 chest X-rays from 40,643 participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, a multi-center, randomized controlled trial designed and sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. 
"We've long recognized that X-rays capture information beyond traditional diagnostic findings, but we haven't used this data because we haven't had robust, reliable methods," Dr. Weiss said. "Advances in AI are making it possible now."
The researchers tested the model using a second independent cohort of 11,430 outpatients (mean age 60.1 years; 42.9% male) who had a routine outpatient chest X-ray at Mass General Brigham and were potentially eligible for statin therapy.
Of 11,430 patients, 1,096, or 9.6%, suffered a major adverse cardiac event over the median follow-up of 10.3 years. There was a significant association between the risk predicted by the CXR-CVD risk deep learning model and observed major cardiac events.
The researchers also compared the prognostic value of the model to the established clinical standard for deciding statin eligibility. This could be calculated in only 2,401 patients (21%) due to missing data (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol) in the electronic record. For this subset of patients, the CXR-CVD risk model performed similarly to the established clinical standard and even provided incremental value.
"The beauty of this approach is you only need an X-ray, which is acquired millions of times a day across the world," Dr. Weiss said. "Based on a single existing chest X-ray image, our deep learning model predicts future major adverse cardiovascular events with similar performance and incremental value to the established clinical standard."
Dr. Weiss said additional research, including a controlled, randomized trial, is necessary to validate the deep learning model, which could ultimately serve as a decision-support tool for treating physicians.
"What we've shown is a chest X-ray is more than a chest X-ray," Dr. Weiss said. "With an approach like this, we get a quantitative measure, which allows us to provide both diagnostic and prognostic information that helps the clinician and the patient."

BitNinja grabs all opportunities to raise awareness of the importance of cybersecurity
DEBRECEN, Hungary, Nov. 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- WebPros APAC Day, on the 16th of November, was the last event that BitNinja attended this year at the Suntec Convention Centre, Singapore , as one of the main sponsors. The event aimed to bring together experts from the hosting industry and provide them with an opportunity to network and share their ideas. The slogan of this occasion was Beyond the Panel. Connecting to the main theme, the CEO of BitNinja, George Egri, gave a speech titled: Server Protection and Beyond. As one of the main factors in the server security industry, BitNinja feels it's their responsibility to raise  awareness about the importance of cybersecurity .

For this reason, George started his speech by informing the audience about the primary motivations of hackers. Most people would think that there is always a financial drive behind every attack. Still, quite a significant percentage of them happen because of other reasons, such as competition, offense, or certainty.
Moving forward, the topic was the customers' needs and requirements towards their hosting providers. Customers are looking for hosting providers who can offer them high availability, so they do not have to worry about their site suddenly crashing and losing valuable data. George explained to the audience the importance of server security in delivering solutions to these demands. As such, a hosting provider should always strive for proactive strategies over reactive ones when selecting a cybersecurity strategy.
He finished his speech by pointing out how BitNinja can help meet these customer requests and how hosting providers can reach their goals, such as high availability, outstanding reputation, low page load, happy customers, and all this, of course, for less cost.
Results
These events always provide a great opportunity to spread the word about cybersecurity's importance. And although that was the last event BitNinja attended this year, it was not the last one they organized. BitNinja is holding an online webinar for VPS providers  on the 6 th of December. Furthermore, they are looking forward to continued success in educating people about the importance of keeping their businesses safe online. Therefore, they have already started preparing for the next Cloudfest in March 2023 with new features and fascinating developments, such as a remodeled, super-fast malware scanner.

BEIJING, Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- This is a news report from Science and Technology Daily:
Education,science and technology, and human resources are the foundational and strategic pillars for building a modern socialist country in all respects. That's according to the report presented to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), marking the first time the three pillars are written into one report chapter.
Science and technology should be regarded as the primary productive force, talent as the primary resource, and innovation as the primary driver of growth, says the report.
"For the first time, the strategy for invigorating China through science and education, the workforce development strategy, and the innovation-driven development strategy are systematically explained in one chapter in the report, which shows the importance of the three strategies in helping the country realize its high-quality development and modernization drive," said Mu Hong, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, at a press conference on October 24.
Mu pointed out that these three strategies jointly serve the building of an innovative country. He further interpreted it in three aspects:
First, priority should be given to education. It is necessary to fully implement the CPC's educational policy, carry out the basic task of fostering virtue through education, continue to follow a people-centered approach to developing education, and move faster toward building a high-quality educational system.
Second, innovation will remain at the heart of China's modernization drive. The country will improve the new system for mobilizing resources nationwide to make key technological breakthroughs, and enhance basic scientific and technological capacity, so as to boost the overall performance of China's innovation system.
Third, the country will adopt more proactive, open, and effective policies on talent, and make concerted efforts to cultivate talented people in all fields, so as to create a large, well-structured, and high-quality workforce. It will also increase international personnel exchanges and make the best use of talent of all types to fully harness their potential.
China will move faster to build world hubs for talent and innovation, promote better distribution and balanced development of talent across regions, and strive to build up its comparative strengths in global competition for talent, according to the report.
To develop a strong workforce for the modernization drive, it is of vital importance to follow the principles of the CPC managing talent, and deepen the institutional reform for personnel development, said Zhang Mingxi, researcher at the Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development (CASTED).
Zhang noted that it is essential to give full play to the decisive role of the market in allocating human resources, along with the government playing a due role. The mechanisms of training, using, evaluating, supporting and encouraging creativity of talent should be improved, and professionals should be free from unnecessary institutional constraints.
To enhance the international competitiveness of Chinese professionals, the country should build a network of exchanges and cooperation in science, technology and education with other countries. High-level experts from all over the world and outstanding young talent are welcomed to study and work in China, said Shi Changhui, also a researcher at CASTED.

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --
WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, continues to investigate potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) resulting from allegations that Schwab may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public.
SO WHAT:  If you purchased Schwab securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. The Rosen Law Firm is preparing a class action seeking recovery of investor losses.
WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the prospective class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=6945 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT:  On July 1, 2021, Schwab disclosed that the Company had been "responding to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) arising from a compliance examination." The investigation primarily concerned "historic disclosures related to the Schwab Intelligent Portfolios® (SIP) digital advisory solution." Schwab further disclosed its "second quarter 2021 financial results will include a liability and related non-deductible charge of $200 million."
On this news, Schwab's share price dropped $0.77 per share, or approximately 1%, to close at $72.80 on July 2, 2021.
On June 13, 2022, the SEC announced that it "charged three Charles Schwab investment adviser subsidiaries" who "agreed to pay $187 million to harmed clients to settle the charges." The SEC charged Schwab with misleading investors that used its robo-adviser product, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios. Instead of the touted "disciplined portfolio construction methodology" that sought "optimal return[s]", Schwab's "own data showed that under most market conditions, the cash in the portfolios would cause clients to make less money even while taking on the same amount of risk."
On this news, Schwab's share price dropped $1.98 per share, or approximately 3%, to close on June 13, 2022 at $60.24.

Full text: Expansion follows GreenField's successful harvest seasons and recent CPG partnerships, onboarding additional farmers to regenerative farming
WICHITA, Kan., Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- GreenField Incorporated, the leader in scaling regenerative farming and offering Robots-as-a-Service to broadacre farmers, has expanded upon its existing partnership with full-service agricultural cooperative MKC to coordinate logistics for its latest consumer packaged goods (CPG) partners: regenerative, plant-based baking mix company Snacktivist Foods and premium pet food brand Canidae™.

ELK GROVE VILLAGE, Ill., Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Orsini Specialty Pharmacy, a leading independent specialty pharmacy focused on rare diseases, and gene therapies, has been selected by Provention Bio, Inc. https://www.gilead.com/as a specialty pharmacy for TZIELD® (teplizumab). TZIELD is the first and only treatment indicated to delay the onset of Stage 3 type 1 diabetes (T1D) in adult and pediatric patients aged 8 years and older with Stage 2 T1D approved by the FDA. For more information about TZIELD, please see the   Full Prescribing Information and Medication Guide  
T1D is a chronic autoimmune condition in which the body's T lymphocyte cells attack healthy beta cells that produce and secrete insulin. More than 10% of the United States population has diabetes; T1D makes up 6% of this group. Although they often are grouped together, T1D is of autoimmune origin, while type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disease. T1D is a growing problem, with an estimated five million people in the U.S. being diagnosed by 2050. Those at the highest risk for progressing to Stage 3 are people with two or more T1D-related autoantibodies and abnormal blood sugar levels. Notably, there has been no disease-modifying innovation for T1D since the development of insulin a century ago.
"Partnering with Provention Bio to provide appropriate patients with access and support for their groundbreaking teplizumab therapy is a real privilege,"  said Mike Fieri, Orsini Specialty Pharmacy Founder and Chief Executive Officer . "We look forward to the opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of people with Stage 2 type 1 diabetes by helping deliver on the promise of TZIELD."

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --
WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, continues to investigate potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of Rollins, Inc. (NYSE: ROL) resulting from allegations that Rollins may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public.
SO WHAT:  If you purchased Rollins securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. The Rosen Law Firm is preparing a class action seeking recovery of investor losses.
WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the prospective class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=2735 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT:  On October 28, 2020, Rollins disclosed that a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation had been initiated and believed the SEC's focus to be how accruals and reserves were established at period ends and their impact on reported earnings going as far back as January 2015.
Then on February 26, 2021, Rollins announced that an internal investigation into the same matters found "a significant deficiency in the Company's internal controls relating to the documentation and review of accounting entries for certain reserves and accruals." On this news, Rollins share prices fell $0.87, or 2.5%, to close at $33.17 per share on February 26, 2021, damaging investors.
Then on April 18, 2022, the SEC announced that Rollins agreed to pay $8 million to settle the charges that Rollins made unsupported reductions to its accounting reserves to improperly boost its earnings per share. On this news, Rollins share price fell $0.55, or approximately 1.7%, to close at $34.29 on April 18, 2022, damaging investors.
WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --
WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Block, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) between November 4, 2021 and April 4, 2022, both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"), of the important December 12, 2022 lead plaintiff deadline .
SO WHAT:  If you purchased Block securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.
WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Block class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=9176 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than December 12, 2022 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Block lacked adequate protocols restricting access to customer sensitive information; (2) as a result, a former employee was able to download certain reports of Block's subsidiary, Cash App Investing, containing full customer names and brokerage account numbers, as well as brokerage portfolio value, brokerage portfolio holdings and/or stock trading activity; (3) as a result, Block was reasonably likely to suffer significant damage, including reputational harm; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, defendant's positive statements about Block's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
To join the Block class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=9176 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.
No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Full text: LONDON, Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Adoption of a smart wireless charging board is a key trend gaining popularity in the wireless charging market. The wireless charging circuit board can send power over distances greater than 15 feet. The most popular wireless technologies in use rely on an electromagnetic field between two copper coils, which greatly limits the distance between a device and a charging pad. For instance, in July 2021, Huawei, a China based Telecommunications equipment company, launched a new multi-device smart wireless charging board. This wireless charging board supports a 15W (x3) large charging area. It can charge three devices at the same time and also, all the devices will be charging at 15W.

The Increase In Electric Vehicle Sales Is An Important Driver For The Wireless Charging Market 
As per the wireless charging market analysis, the rising popularity and high sales of electric vehicles (EV) are expected to drive the wireless charging market in the forecast period. All-electric vehicles, also referred to as battery electric vehicles (BEVs), have an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine. The electromagnetic induction technique is used in wireless charging to send electrical power through the atmosphere as a magnetic field.
Wireless Charging Market Segmentation
The global wireless charging market research is segmented -
- By Components: Transmitters, Receivers
- By Technology: Inductive Charging, Resonant Charging, Radio Frequency Based Charging, Others
- By Transmission Range: Short Range, Medium Range, Long Range
- By Application: Consumer Electronics, Automotive, Healthcare, Industrial, Defense, Others
The High Cost Of Raw Materials Will Limit The Wireless Charging Market Growth
The high cost of raw materials would decrease the growth of the wireless charging market. The high costs might have an impact on the volume of products that can be produced and distributed. For instance, in 2021, according to the Canadian government, the Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) showed that prices of goods manufactured in Canada grew 3.0% month over month in January 2022 and were 16.9% higher than in January 2021. In January 2022, the Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) showed a monthly increase of 6.5 % and a year-over-year increase of 30.5% for raw materials purchased by Canadian firms.

Full text: And what better way to announce it than in the form of a classic holiday poem?
ORLANDO, Fla. , Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --
'Twas the month before Christmas and all through the state
The ABC dream team was staying up late;
Polishing up this year's holiday ad
in hopes that good-spirited fun would be had
A campaign to sweep you right off your feet
to shake you and stir you and serve you up neat
To show off our shelves from ceiling to floor
(And possibly mention all 125 stores)
A promo to highlight we're family owned
and remind you we sit on the liquor store throne
One that mentions delivery: curbside and front door
And expert-picked wines that we're happy to pour
Then up from Creative, on fluttering wings
A sweet angel whispered, "Focus on just one thing"
So we got in a huddle and knew what to do
a steadfast promise that always rings true:
Whether gifting or guzzling, you want to impress
and here at ABC, you can do that for less
Yes, you can live large without breaking the bank
And when your guests are dazzled, you'll have us to thank
More rapid than reindeer, our ideas they came
And we whistled and shouted these values by name:
Now small batch ! Now new brands ! Now rare and cool finds !
On top shelf ! On specialty liquor and wines!
To the screen! On their phone! To a sign that they'll see!
Now, tell all Floridians about ABC!
Our boozy utopia with shelves to the sky
has selection so good it brings a tear to your eye
And hark! All this luxury comes at a good price
Our costs are not naughty, they're shockingly nice
Now how do you tie this all up in a bow?
You use holiday references everyone knows
Like a disgruntled dad obsessed with his lights
Like the parents whose kid didn't get on their flight
Like lords that are leaping and silly gift swaps
If they all had their way, ABC's where they'd shop
So, here's a sneak peek, we think that you'll love it:
Get Champagne Taste On An Eggnog Budget

epilogue

Full text: Xingjun Wang, xingjun.wang@chindatagroup.com
BEIJING, Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- On November 22, 2022, Chindata Group Holdings Limited ("Chindata Group" or the "Company") (Nasdaq: CD), a leading carrier-neutral hyperscale data center solution provider in Asia-Pacific emerging markets, announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended Septemper 30, 2022. With the increasing demand for digital infrastructure globally, as well as the catalyst provided by the "East Data West Computation" policy, the company continued its solid business performance in the third quarter of 2022. Total IT capacity of the data center by the end of the third quarter of 2022 increased to 821MW. The close collaboration between the team in China and South East Asia led to a record nine-straight-quarters of upbeat financial performance. Revenue was RMB1,202.7 million in the third quarter of 2022, which was a 62.4% year over year ("YoY") growth. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2022 increased by 66.8% YoY to RMB614.5 million, with a margin of 51.1%. GAAP Net income was RMB241.0 million in the third quarter of 2022, which was a 207.4% YoY growth, with a margin of 20.0% at new high. Revenue in the first nine months of 2022 has surpassed that of the full year of 2021. The company also raised its full year guidance for the second time in the year, which currently expects the full year revenue to be in the range of RMB4.33 billion to RMB4.43 billion, representing an increase of RMB200 million in mid-point compared with the previous guidance.
By the end of the third quarter of 2022, Chindata Group has added one new project with an additional 45MW new capacity, bringing the total capacity to 821MW, and total number of data centers to 31. The Company continued to serve its existing clients and support their healthy growth as a trusted partner, and the momentum on the overall demand from its unique client base remained strong and healthy. Total contracted and "Indication of Interest" (IOI) capacity increased by 50MW during the third quarter of 2022 to reach 700MW, representing a 41.9% YoY growth.
The emerging market is one of the key areas of Chindata Group's global layout. In the third quarter of 2022, a hyperscale data center located in India was successfully delivered to support the Company's key international clients. On October 20, 2022, the Company celebrated the grand opening of project MY06 in Sedenak, Johor, Malaysia. The entire MY06 project holds a designed capacity of over 100MW, among which 19MW was recently put into service in October. Excluding the delivery of MY06-1, by the end of the third quarter of 2022, the Company had 40MW in-service capacity, and another 120MW under construction in Asia-Pacific emerging markets, as well as the Thailand project to be further expanded.
Chindata Group believes that its early judgement in site selection in the Greater Beijing Region and its differentiated way of doing business and continuing to do the right thing in the correct manner, are consistently generating healthy resources, which further enable the Company to tap into different regions for business opportunities and to establish a more diversified business layout.
At present, Chindata Group has a layout in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, the Yangtze River Delta Area, the Greater Bay Area, and Gansu, which is highly consistent with the national "East Data West Computation" policy, and becomes one of the largest third-party hyperscale data center enterprises in eight computing "hub nodes" in China. In Asia-Pacific emerging markets, Chindata Group has two hyperscale data centers in service and four under construction in India and Malaysia, as well as the Thailand project to be further expanded.
The company also maintained a healthy capital structure under the current challenging market environment. Chindata Group's prudent financing policy, healthy cash generation, asset return and profitability have together made this possible. These combined financial performance on both output and input sides resulted in an unlevered pre-tax Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) at around 17% level, which will provide a safe and long-term sustainable value to the investors and creditors.
In the third quarter of 2022, Chindata Group continued to devote to its innovation and research & development for better data center solutions. The total approved and pending patents by the end of the third quarter of 2022 reached 400, compared with 361 by the end of the second quarter of 2022.
Regarding other effort on sustainability, the Company entered into a green loan agreement in September with a bank on project financing for its project in one of its Hebei campuses. The loan is aligned with Green Loan Principles (2021 Edition), with all loan proceeds intended for green building, renewable energy and energy efficiency related to the project.
Mr. Huapeng Wu, Chief Executive Officer of Chindata Group, commented, "The Company continued its solid business performance in the third quarter of 2022. The close collaboration between our team in China and South East Asia led to a record nine-straight-quarters of upbeat financial performance. Revenue in the first nine months of 2022 has surpassed the revenue in the full year of 2021, and we are raising our full year guidance for the second time this year. With the increasing demand for digital infrastructure globally, as well as the catalyst provided by the "East Data West Computation" policy, the Company sees its advantages in hyperscale business to be even more apparent. We will continue to do the right thing in the correct manner, to consistently build our capability, to strengthen our research & development, to enhance our competitive power and to operate our business in a prudent manner, so as to create long-term value for our clients, partners, investors and other stakeholders in a sustainable way."

Full text: - Underscores BMO's commitment to helping communities create sustainable change
- Addresses key barriers faced by minority businesses, communities, and families
- Builds on the progress of BMO EMpower, a $5 billion commitment to an inclusive economic recovery launched in 2020

CHICAGO, Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - BMO today announced a Community Benefits Plan (CBP) that outlines a more than $40 billion commitment to local communities in the United States, with over $16 billion of the plan commitment targeted for the State of California. This plan outlines commitments to local communities across BMO's expanded footprint in the United States after the approval and closing of its proposed acquisition of Bank of the West, announced on December 20, 2021. The acquisition remains subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.
The five-year plan was developed with input from over 85 community groups from across the country through listening sessions facilitated by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition and the California Reinvestment Coalition, the Alliance to Close the Racial Wealth Gap, a public meeting and written comments submitted to regulators. The plan reinforces BMO's focus on increasing home ownership and supporting the growth of small businesses in low- to moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods and communities of color. It also strengthens these communities through investments and lending to support affordable housing and economic development as well as philanthropic giving.
"We want to thank all of the community groups that invested their time to meet with us and provide feedback that has helped shape this plan," said David Casper, U.S. CEO, BMO Financial Group. "We are committed to ongoing community engagement to realize the full potential of this plan."
The CBP continues and expands on the progress by both BMO and Bank of the West to promote economic growth and provide greater access to capital for all. The result is a bold plan that will increase investment and expand BMO's strategic partnerships in underserved communities. It's also an expansion of, and is incremental to, the BMO EMpower initiative, a $5 billion commitment which was launched by BMO Financial Group in 2020 to advance an inclusive economic recovery in the United States through a series of long-term initiatives designed to drive meaningful change and champion racial equity.
The more than $40 billion commitment includes:
- Advancing Home Ownership: $7.5 billion in home mortgage lending, including $5.1 billion for the State of California, to support LMI and minority homeowners. Key commitments and programs include:
- More than 75 percent of home mortgage lending under the plan to people and communities of color
- The launch of a new Welcome Home Grant program in San Francisco and San Jose with over $125 million in home mortgage lending
- The creation of a $3 million Native Community Housing Fund to support affordable housing on tribal trust lands


- Growing Small Businesses: $16.5 billion in small business lending, including $5.3 billion for the State of California, that will help jumpstart the growth of small businesses in underserved communities across BMO's footprint. Key commitments include:
- Close to 60 percent of small business lending targeted to minority communities
- A $200 million commitment to expand BMO's small business programs that support women, Black and Latinx-owned businesses, and a new program for Native American-owned businesses


- Strengthening Communities: $17.5 billion, including $6.1 billion for the State of California, in community development loans, investments, and other support for underserved communities to create greater opportunity for success. This commitment:
- Includes $12 billion in lending for affordable housing and economic development and $3 billion in investments in low-income housing and new market tax credits, CDFIs, CRA-qualified private equity and other loan funds


- Creating a More Equitable Society: Over 50 percent of the plan is expected to benefit communities and borrowers of color to help close the racial wealth gap and advance a more inclusive society. Key commitments include:
- More than $15 billion in small business and home mortgage lending to minority borrowers or in minority communities
- $325 million in special purpose credit programs for mortgage and small business lending designed for women and borrowers of color, including BMO's newly launched small business program for Native Americans


"We have a duty to continue addressing the barriers that disproportionately affect people of color and remain committed to creating more opportunities that achieve progress for all," Casper added. "Our Community Benefits Plan reflects our promise to ensure we have a strong combination of financial and community-driven investments that will create a more equitable society anywhere we do business. Eliminating barriers to inclusion while building a thriving economy and sustainable future is at the core of our Purpose to Boldly Grow the Good in business and life ."
"BMO's commitment to work together with us and leading community groups was vital to creating a plan that drives significant impact to the communities served," said Jesse Van Tol, President and CEO, NCRC. "This community benefits plan is a substantial move in the right direction by addressing racial equity and access to capital in specific and tangible ways that will create more economic inclusion in the markets where BMO operates."
"We commend BMO leadership for its collaboration with the California Reinvestment Coalition (CRC) and our members over the last several months to put together an agreement that reflects the needs of California communities," said Paulina Gonzalez-Brito, CRC CEO. "Mergers must provide a clear public benefit. This agreement accomplishes this through increased investment and services in LMI communities and communities of color and increased lending to BIPOC-owned small businesses. We look forward to working with BMO as it implements this agreement over the next five years."
After closing, the combined organization will provide greater convenience, more product choice and increased community engagement through the following:
- Increased Convenience
- Over 1,000 branches and fee-free access to over 42,000 ATMs
- Five new financial services (FS) offices in underserved areas
- Maintaining Bank of the West branches, with no planned closures related to the transaction
- A strong, user-friendly digital platform


- Broader Array of Goods and Services for New Customers – enabling increased access to banking and real financial progress
- Retail products specifically designed to address the needs of LMI customers
- Reduced fees on many accounts
- Robust financial education resources
- Bank-funded down payment mortgage assistance programs


- Enhanced Community Engagement
- Community Advisory Council
- Annual meetings with key partners in new markets and neighborhoods
- Committed philanthropic funds for local organizations supporting affordable homeownership and small businesses
- Committed to new partnerships in our expanded footprint


With a focus on collaboration, learning, and innovation, BMO will continue to work with community partners to achieve sustainable solutions and shape the future together.

BEIJING, Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- A news report by China.org.cn: A thematic study on practical new technologies and the latest practices in empowering agricultural value chain development.
 
"Sci-Tech Empowering Rural Transformation 2022 Report: Digital Technology Empowers Agricultural Value Chain Development" was released at the 2022 International Forum on Digital Technology Empowering Rural Transformation, which was held online on Nov. 25. The report outlines and summarises development trends associated with science and technology-powered transformation in rural areas, practical new techniques and technologies, and select best practices, with a special emphasis on those that are innovative, sustainable, and applicable to developing countries.
The report suggests that digital agriculture, and especially smart agricultural machinery, can effectively optimise operations such as planting and harvesting; facilitate precision application of seed, fertiliser, and pesticide; reduce grain loss and harm to human health; control non-point source pollution; conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions; and address other problems via unmanned operations and notes that the approach can, therefore, "greatly improve labour productivity, yields, and resource utilisation and promote sustainable development of agriculture."
The report highlights the key role that digital technology plays in the bolstering of agricultural value chain development, observing that this type of development is mostly reflected in supply chain development, brand building, and digitalisation of production, supply, and sales in eastern China and that capacity building and training and digitally powered smallholder value chain development consolidate China's poverty reduction efforts and thus lay a solid foundation for rural vitalisation in western China.
It also notes that promoting rural development with digital finance "cannot be achieved overnight" and that the endeavour is a "gradual process that moves towards overall financial inclusion with advances in digital infrastructure and digital technology and pertinent government policies that requires necessary conditions to be met and various problems and challenges to be taken into account."
China Internet Information Center (CIIC), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Representation in China, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) China Office, World Food Programme (WFP) China, and the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific – Centre for Sustainable Agricultural Mechanization (ESCAP-CSAM) initiated the project that led to the publication of the "Sci-Tech Empowering Rural Transformation 2022 Report," and it was compiled by CIIC, FAO Representation in China, the IFAD China Office, WFP China Centre of Excellence, ESCAP-CSAM, AliResearch and the Chinese Academy of Financial Inclusion. 
Robert Walker, professor at Beijing Normal University's School of Sociology and fellow at the U.K.'s Academy of Social Sciences, said that digital agricultural mechanization and precision agriculture, together with digital technology to support e-commerce and digital finance, fundamentally have the capacity to enhance the ecology of the rural economy. However, "digital advance needs to be accompanied by sustained improvements in the physical, social, and policy infrastructure to ensure inevitable inequities introduced by digitization can be readily rectified."
"Your dedication in studying and researching agri-food-related technologies is key to driving rural transformation, agricultural value chain development, and rural economies and [supporting] communities and natural resource management that we need," Siddharth Chatterjee, United Nations resident coordinator in China, expressed during the event, referring to all of the parties that have been involved with the report. "More significantly, your efforts are also aimed at engineering South-South and triangular cooperation in the subject area, thus promoting agricultural and rural development in other developing countries. This well illustrated the value proposition of UN agencies in China."
Participants also touched on the FAO's Digital Village Initiative, which entails promoting digital innovations in rural communities in order to boost livelihoods, wellbeing and social cohesion. With many possibilities related to the application and harnessing of digital innovations and services coming into existence, the concept is not wedded to any fixed pathway or approach.
"The FAO is implementing the Digital Villages Initiative globally in order to support the sustainable development of agri-food systems through digital agriculture, digital services for farmers and rural digital transformation," Carlos Watson, FAO representative to China, said in an interview with China.org.cn. "So far, 10 Chinese case studies have been recognized."
"The FAO will work with the Chinese government, to exchange China's Digital Village experience and good practices in the Asia-Pacific region and globally through South-South and triangular cooperation," he concluded.
Qu Sixi, WFP representative to China, revealed that this report is an excellent demonstrator of the value and role of digital technology empowerment in rural development in China. "Digital technology empowers production to be more efficient, markets to be more integrated and financial services to be more convenient. It plays a significant role in promoting China's rural value chain construction and generates a good effect on China's poverty reduction, which can provide stories of success for other developing countries." He continued, "The WFP China Centre of Excellence is focusing on digital South-South cooperation to promote the application, demonstration and dissemination of digital technologies in South-South cooperation so that more farmers in developing countries can benefit from digital technology development and progress."
Discussing integration with China's Digital Village strategy, Sun Yinhong, Country Program Officer of IFAD China, mentioned that IFAD is dedicated to improving digital-based financial service for farmers and rural small and micro businesses through financial education, value chain financing with banks and other financial institutions, digital credit models based on digital agriculture scenarios, weather index insurance, and assistance with the development of digital financial services models and products to various financial institutions at the forum.
"IFAD will also support China's Digital Village development and promote the application of modern information technologies, such as 5G, cloud technology, the IoTs, and big data, in agricultural and rural management," Sun remarked in an interview with China.org.cn.
"China and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region can share the latest advancements in digital agriculture and smart agricultural machinery and equipment and promote their application in order to harness data and information and treat them as core elements of food production when engaging in South-South and triangular cooperation," Li Yutong, head of ESCAP-CSAM, noted in relation to the great potential of digital technology in rural transformation in an interview with China.org.cn. "This will help strengthen the capacity and resilience of countries in the region to ensure food security, boost poverty reduction and address climate change."
Tan Chongjun, deputy director of AliResearch, stated, "We hope more countries will find their own digital development paths. In light of their prevailing conditions, developing countries can learn useful international experiences from China and other countries, adopt extensive public policies to incentive sustainable and inclusive growth, pour more investment in logistics and IT infrastructure and human capital to narrow the digital divide, forge sound cooperation between the public and private sectors, give full attention to the role of digitalization and online business in rural innovation and entrepreneurship, encourage mass entrepreneurship and innovation, and let more people share the dividends of digitalization."
"CIIC has been very active in the field of international communication in areas such as poverty reduction and rural development over the past few years," Wang Xiaohui, the organisation's editor-in-chief said. "This report is our latest attempt in communicating China's rural vitalisation experiences with international audiences."
"Looking ahead, CIIC will continue to promote China's campaign of boosting rural development with technology and promote the exchange of experience among developing countries through knowledge sharing by making full use of its comprehensive multi-lingual, multi-platform media advantages," he added.
2022 International Forum on Digital Technology Empowering Rural Transformation was co-hosted by CIIC, FAO Representation in China, the IFAD China Office, WFP China, and ESCAP-CSAM, and academic support was provided by AliResearch, the Chinese Academy of Financial Inclusion, and the School of Languages and Communication Studies, Beijing Jiaotong University.

Full text: BOSTON, Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Recognized as one of the key technologies essential to achieving net-zero emissions targets, the momentum behind carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) deployment is building up. The new IDTechEx report, "Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) Markets 2023-2043", highlights what the CCUS industry has been doing to overcome historical challenges and position itself to reach the scale required for net-zero emissions, a bold goal set by more than 70 countries and recently reinforced at the UN's Climate Change Conference (COP27).
IDTechEx's updated report brings the latest developments across the CCUS industry that have shaped the current market landscape, including regulatory incentives, business models, project delivery strategy, technological innovation, and more. Based on the drivers and hurdles for CCUS uptake, IDTechEx's latest forecast expects the global CCUS capacity to reach 1.8 gigatonnes per annum by 2043. Although still a modest capacity compared to what is needed for countries to achieve their net-zero commitments, attaining the gigatonne level of CCUS deployment will mean unprecedented growth to the industry and large amounts of investments.
The CCUS Market: Will It Finally Take off?
CCUS encompasses a range of technologies designed to capture carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions and provide long-term sequestration solutions or utilization routes for the captured CO₂. Though deployment over the past ten years has been slower than what is needed to limit global warming, CCUS' competitive suitability to decarbonize 'hard-to-abate' industries such as energy, chemicals, cement, and steel production, has shifted the narrative from whether CCUS is needed, towards how quickly can it be deployed at scale.
As decarbonization commitments worldwide grow, the CCUS industry is starting to shift to new business models of dedicated CO₂ storage and emerging use cases for CO₂ such as CO₂-based polymers or building materials. The market has been dominated by enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which involves pumping CO₂ in geological reservoirs to extract additional fossil fuels, due to the difficulty in making an economical business case for the safe disposal of CO₂ alone. However, IDTechEx's new research finds that with rising carbon prices, favorable regulation, and an ever-growing demand for lower-carbon-intensity products, the revenue streams are becoming more diverse, making the market signals stronger for CCUS deployment.
In this new report, IDTechEx also explores how the sector is moving away from full-chain CCUS projects (integrated capture, transport, and storage or use that serve one large emitter) to developing multi-user, shared infrastructure networks. Many CCUS project developers are investing in a CCUS 'as-a-service' model by linking nearby CO₂ emitters through a collection hub and then transporting the CO₂ to clusters of storage or utilization sinks, either by ship or backbone pipelines. The concept is akin to waste management and is set to reduce commercial risk and foster economies of scale, although it requires coordination amongst multiple players. Adapting to the new needs of the CCUS market, carbon capture players upstream are offering the next generation of modular, easy-to-retrofit carbon capture units to serve emitters of all sizes across many industries, particularly waste-to-energy, cement, iron & steel, and hydrogen.
What to Expect from This Report?
IDTechEx's new CCUS report provides a comprehensive overview of the CCUS market, including a 20-year market forecast across 12 sub-categories of CCUS, historical data of CCUS projects, details on future projects announced to date, nearly 40 company profiles, and technology benchmarking, all to give the reader a clear picture of the CCUS landscape.

Full text: CHARLOTTE, N.C., Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of America Corporation (" Bank of America ") (NYSE: BAC) previously announced the commencement of 14 concurrent, but separate, offers (collectively, the " Offers ") by BofA Securities, Inc. (" BofA Securities "), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Bank of America, to purchase for cash up to $1.5 billion in aggregate Liquidation Preference (as defined below) of outstanding Depositary Shares, representing fractional interests in 14 separate series of Bank of America preferred stock (such depositary shares, collectively, the " Depositary Shares ," and such depositary shares representing a specific series of such preferred stock, a " series " of Depositary Shares), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in BofA Securities' Offer to Purchase, dated November 10, 2022 (as amended, and as may be further amended or supplemented from time to time, the " Offer to Purchase ") and the accompanying Letter of Transmittal (together with the Offer to Purchase, the " Offer Documents ").  Today, Bank of America announces the hypothetical Accrued Dividends (as defined below) and hypothetical Total Consideration for the LIBOR Depositary Shares (as defined below) sought in the Offers, as described in greater detail below and certain amendments to the Offer to Purchase. 
As previously announced and as described in the Offer to Purchase, the total consideration payable for Depositary Shares of certain series that are purchased pursuant to the Offers (such amount, with respect to Depositary Shares of a series, the " Total Consideration "), including the Series E Depositary Shares, the Series 1 Depositary Shares, and the Series 5 Depositary Shares listed in the table below (such series of Depositary Shares collectively, the " LIBOR Depositary Shares ") will equal the applicable Offer Price (as specified in the Offer to Purchase and set forth in the table below) for such Depositary Shares, plus the applicable Accrued Dividends (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) for such Depositary Shares. The dividend rates for the LIBOR Depositary Shares are reset quarterly based on 3-month U.S. dollar LIBOR. Such dividend rates were reset following BofA Securities' commencement of the Offers. As a result, as of the date of the commencement of the Offers, the applicable dividend rates to be used to calculate hypothetical Accrued Dividends for the LIBOR Depositary Shares were not known, and it was not possible to determine hypothetical Accrued Dividends and hypothetical Total Consideration for the LIBOR Depositary Shares. Such applicable dividend rates for the series of the LIBOR Depositary Shares, as well as the hypothetical Accrued Dividends and hypothetical Total Consideration for such LIBOR Depositary Shares, have now been determined and calculated. The table below sets forth certain information relating to the LIBOR Depositary Shares, including the hypothetical Accrued Dividends and hypothetical Total Consideration.

Full text: Property Services Firm Opens Seven Service Center Locations with Dedicated Professionals in 2022; Targets Additional Expansion in 2023 and Beyond
LEWISVILLE, Texas, Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- MCS, the national property services company founded in 1986, celebrated establishing a network of regional self-performing Service Centers – facilities with locally and robustly staffed project management and service tech teams – in seven markets in 2022, and announced plans to open 10 or more in 2023. As a first in the property services industry, MCS will open a network of self-performing service centers to support all facets of the default mortgage, property preservation, commercial, and residential rental segments, leveraging its own dedicated project management teams and service crews across major U.S. markets to better serve its growing client base.
"Best-in-class customer service has been our competitive advantage for more than 35 years, and the establishment of MCS Service Centers across the country furthers our edge in providing excellent service across a large and growing volume of residential and commercial properties," said Craig Torrance, MCS's Chief Executive Officer. "Our Service Centers, in combination with our long-established national network of service providers, fortify our ability to deliver responsive and meticulous care to brighten and revitalize neighborhoods across the nation."
In 2022, MCS opened Service Centers in Phoenix, Dallas, Las Vegas, Orlando and Columbus, OH, with additional Service Centers slated to open in Atlanta and Tucson before year's end. Markets on the MCS Service Center expansion roadmap include Houston, Tampa, Chicago, Salt Lake City, Denver, Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, Charlotte, Detroit and other markets in Florida and Texas, while assessing opportunities in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
Service Centers are staffed with a market director, project managers, estimators and highly trained service technicians to execute the field property services needs of the firm's clients across the Mortgage, Residential Rental and Commercial Services lines of business. Additionally, MCS employs 12 of its own inspectors across Phoenix, Dallas, Columbus, Atlanta, Orlando, and Las Vegas with the ability to provide a variety of inspection services – including occupancy, property condition, disaster and loss draft inspections – across each respective state and nearby regions as needed.
MCS's hybrid service model combines an expansive network of local service partners with the company's own expertise and use of innovative technologies to ensure transparency, enhance quality control and code compliance, and maximize efficiencies, ultimately driving client satisfaction.
"Our network of Service Centers allows MCS to act as an extension of SFR owner/operators' team by providing 'boots-on-the-ground' services that might otherwise be challenging for investors to handle on their own," said Andrew Nolan, President, Commercial and Residential Rental Services, for MCS. "Our national platform gives us the advantage of scale with the important benefit of a local presence to perform or oversee work, while consolidated programs create efficiencies and enhance service delivery through aggregation and technology-driven processes."
Staff-up at each service center is highly methodical using local networks to build teams with regional know-how and connections to facilitate the most appropriate servicing solutions. From inspection services and occupied maintenance to turns and renovations, as well as preserving foreclosed and vacant properties, MCS and its Service Centers provide their residential clients the bandwidth to handle the many moving parts required to successfully manage their portfolios.  
"For property preservation, companies have typically provided maintenance and inspection services primarily through a third-party network of vendors and contractors," added Chad Mosely, President, Mortgage Services for MCS. "MCS is transforming the property preservation sector through our combined network of Service Centers and trusted local service partners to ensure vacant properties remain in good condition."
Additionally, MCS's Service Centers and vendor network provides a robust suite of offerings for commercial properties – from office parks and car washes to big box retailers and national/regional brands that demand brand consistency across multiple locations. The established processes, existing technology platforms, and accessibility to local trade professionals give commercial owner/operators a one-stop-shop for an efficient, tech-forward program providing services such as landscaping and snow removal as well as interior services such as electrical, plumbing and routine repairs. MCS also offers its own software to manage vendor work orders which seamlessly interfaces with existing technology platforms.
"We have long managed high volumes of property services on behalf of financial institutions and owners in major markets across the nation, and we are confident that our innovative hybrid model for field service delivery and management fortifies MCS for the long-term," Mr. Torrance noted.
About MCS MCS is a leading property services provider working across Commercial Properties, Single-Family Rentals, and the Property Preservation industry. For over 35 years, MCS has been committed to responsive care, industry-leading service standards, leveraging technology, and end-to-end transparency to protect, preserve and serve communities across the country. Some of the largest and most respected mortgage servicers, real estate owners and operators, and corporations trust MCS to perform property inspections, preservation, maintenance, renovations, and other property-related services.

SOTYKTU is the first and only approved TYK2 inhibitor in Canada and represents an important milestone in oral treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in nearly eight years 
MONTREAL, Nov. 28, 2022 /CNW/ - Bristol Myers Squibb Canada (BMS) today announced that Health Canada has approved SOTYKTU (deucravacitinib tablets), the first-in-its-class oral tablet for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. 1
"Being able to offer an effective, once-daily oral treatment to my patients is extraordinarily exciting. We have so many patients who are looking for a convenient alternative to topical and existing treatments. A once-daily oral treatment has the potential to change the current standard of care and its proven efficacy will improve patients' quality of life," said Dr. Kim A. Papp, MD, Ph.D., FRCPC, President and Founder, Probity Medical Research. "I know my patients face not only significant physical challenges because of their psoriasis, but they also confront mental and daily social challenges due to the nature of their condition."
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory condition impacting the lives of nearly a million Canadians across the country. 2 The severity of the condition ranges from dandruff-like scales to patches that cover large areas of skin. 2 Plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis, 3 most often appearing on elbows and knees, and with over half of patients on their scalps. 2 ,4 These patches of affected skin are inflamed and sensitive to the touch, 5 resulting in experiences that impact daily activities such as walking, exercising, going to restaurants or shopping for groceries. Additionally, psoriasis patients often face mental health challenges resulting in issues such as social anxiety, depression and lack of self-esteem. 6  
SOTYKTU is a tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor, which works by selectively blocking the activity of the "TYK2" enzyme, which is involved in the process of inflammation. 1 Studies have demonstrated that TYK2 inhibitors are well-tolerated in patients with psoriasis. 7 SOTYKTU helps control inflammation affiliated with psoriasis and helps to reduce symptoms such as itching, pain, burning, stinging, skin tightness, skin plaque, and associated signs. 1  SOTYKTU has been shown to improve quality of life, with the condition having less of an impact on daily activities, relationships, and other factors. 1
"SOTYKTU has a novel mechanism of action and is the newest oral treatment for psoriasis in nearly eight years. The approval of SOTYKTU reinforces our dedication to patients and our passion for innovation," said Troy André, General Manager, Bristol Myers Squibb Canada. "As our first psoriasis product, we are proud of this milestone and continued legacy of developing and offering innovative therapeutic options to those who need it."
Health Canada's approval of SOTYKTU is based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 POETYK PSO-1 and POETYK PSO-2 clinical trials, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of SOTYKTU (6 mg once daily) compared to placebo and apremilast (30 mg twice daily) in patients 18 years of age and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were eligible for systemic therapy or phototherapy. 1  Both were multi-national, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled 52-week Phase 3 studies. The co-primary endpoints of both POETYK PSO-1 and POETYK PSO-2 were the percentage of patients who achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 and the percentage of patients who achieved static Physician's Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 at Week 16 versus placebo. 1

- Development of mobile collaborative robots and self-driving logistics robots … an integrated system for controlling multiple robots.
- Implementation in general manufacturing sites and smart factories … expected to expand human-friendly robotics services.
- Robo-wheel technology anticipated to widen the scope of robotics solutions for outdoor uses.

SEOUL, Korea, Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Hyundai Mobis (KRX: 012330), a pioneer in the future smart mobility solution industry, introduces robots that can be used at general manufacturing sites or in smart factories. The robots will feature a set of technologies that encourage safe interactions between robots and their human counterparts. With its expansion into the robotics industry, Hyundai Mobis is once again strengthening its position as a leader in essential future vehicle technologies, including electrification and autonomous driving.
Hyundai Mobis announced on 28 that it had recently completed the development of mobile collaborative robotic and logistics robotic systems based on autonomous driving, which have been implemented for pilot operation in its Ulsan plant. The collaborative and logistics robots can be utilized in manufacturing or distribution bases as well as in service locations. Hyundai Mobis has also succeeded in developing an exclusive integrated controller and control system, which are required to provide the robotic solutions.
The mobile robots with articulated arms move autonomously in different environments, such as factories or offices, performing tasks in collaboration with the persons in charge. Mobile collaborative robots are equipped with cameras and LiDAR sensors, allowing them to move in various directions, such as back and forth or sideways.
By far the most prominent feature of these robots is that they are able to offer mobile services. Unlike general industrial robots or wearable robots, mobile collaborative robots serve various purposes both at home and in commercial spaces. The vision cameras and moving arms of the robots allow them to perform interactive tasks with their human counterparts, such as arranging products on the shelf or delivering a cup of coffee brewed by a barista to a table.
The self-driving logistic robots also developed by Hyundai Mobis are low-floor robots that move freely between production lines and distribution warehouses to transport supplies or goods. The 152 mm-tall robots can carry up to 200 kg with the ability to lift up to 12 cm. Using the equipped LiDARs and camera and ultrasonic wave-enabled sensors, these robots are capable of identifying their own locations at the site and also of delivering materials via optimal paths that have been set to avoid workers and obstacles.
In addition, Hyundai Mobis secured a system that allows for integrated control of multiple self-driving logistics robots within one workplace. The key to this control system is preventing collisions and deadlocks between robots. Hyundai Mobis developed and applied a proprietary algorithm that predicts and controls in real time the movement of multiple robots.
Hyundai Mobis is also developing a robotics system that can be used outdoors. The system will incorporate the robo-wheel technology, which has been designed to help the robots move safely in outdoor environments, such as slopes and bumpy road surfaces. The built-in control algorithm of the robo-wheel will facilitate various driving motions, including a 360-degree zero turn and sideways crab driving.
Lee Seung-Hwan, the Head of the Advanced Engineering at Hyundai Mobis, said "We are brainstorming innovative and creative ideas to develop safe and precise robotics technologies. We hope to use these human-robot collaborative solutions to further expand the scope of our business."
Hyundai Mobis plans to develop various robot platforms based on the elemental technologies of the mobile collaborative robots and self-driving logistics robots that are currently under development. The project will focus on advancing the human-robot interface, robot driving, and robot control technologies, which will be utilized in a variety of areas, such as smart factories, distribution bases, offices, and households.
In March, Hyundai Mobis added UAM and robotics to its business portfolio as part of its initiative to secure long-term growth engines, simultaneously announcing its goal to scale the business model to encompass next-generation growth areas. (End)

Full text: OSLO, Norway , Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- With another year of uncertainty ahead of us, business leaders must prepare for what lies ahead and Neptune Software has identified three key trends to pay attention to. To keep a competitive advantage in this era of variability, businesses must lean into hybrid work models, prioritize sustainability, and brace for a down-turning economy by centering innovation.
"While there was an initial hope that this year would bring more stability to businesses large and small; the reality is that leaders must learn to live in uncertainty and be both willing and prepared to adapt," said Andreas Sulejewski, CEO at Neptune Software. "With shifting employee preferences, climate change, and a looming hazy economic outlook, I anticipate next year will bring even more unpredictability. The well-being of employers, employees, and the planet relies on businesses embracing hybrid work norms, prioritizing sustainability, and staying innovative in the face of rising inflation."
Making a hybrid work environment work While pre-pandemic, most US jobs were done fully on-site, employees' shifting preferences and priorities toward flexibility means nearly three-quarters of U.S. employers are planning to, or have already, implemented fully hybrid work environments. To make a hybrid model work for its employees, businesses must establish rules of etiquette that allow employees to feel that they're still included and valued, wherever they may be working from. That means investing in their digital infrastructure, especially collaboration-driven technologies that mimic the quick, spontaneous hallway conversations and ad-hoc brainstorming sessions of an in-person office environment.
The key is empowering employees to feel like they're still in the room together, while also offering the flexibility to complete tasks how and when it works for them.
Prioritizing sustainability Climate change continues to devastate the planet, making sustainability more imperative than ever for businesses. Many enterprises are finding success by digitizing their supply chains and reducing paper use, saving time and boosting efficiency. This kind of digital transformation  has the potential to remove toxins from supply chains by up to a factor of 100 and reduce carbon emissions by at least 20 percent.
The reality is,  businesses are facing increased pressure from investors, consumers, and the media, amongst others, to improve the sustainability of their supply chains. Likewise, more and more business leaders are considering environmental sustainability as a major factor in improving or creating products. Failing to prioritize sustainability as part of the business model going forward not only risks the health of the planet, but the health of the business.
Reducing costs in a down-turning economy by staying innovative, agile, and turning things around quickly Concerns over inflation, rising interest rates, and rising commodity prices all point to a looming recession. While keeping costs low is critical for profitability, gaining a competitive edge often means employees are overworked –– and hiring additional staff isn't an option. Still, businesses can weather the storm –– and even thrive despite it –– by focusing on  innovation , which requires enterprises to remain adaptable and receptive to the needs and behaviors of their customers. This empowers them to turn solutions around quickly.
So how do businesses deliver results through innovation? One way is to lean on low- and no-code platforms. These toolsets put the power of development with business units, which lowers costs and reduces development time, while continuing to allow expanded capacity.
Neptune Software's software, Neptune DXP, continues to be the leading low-code, SAP-centric app development platform, giving IT professionals the right tools to build the apps they need at scale and with ease.

Full text: TORONTO, Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - To support the protests for regime change in Iran, Iranian fans at the World Cup are holding up signs and banners that say, "Woman, Life, Freedom." But, FIFA isn't allowing cameras to show them on the broadcast.
Iranian banners and flags may be barred from stadiums in Qatar, but there's nothing that can stop chants.
With millions of viewers expected to tune into Tuesday, Nov 29th's 2pm EST match between Iran and USA, the YWCA—a grassroots-driven, global movement rooted in the leadership of women, young women, and girls—is urging US and Iranian football fans to unite for women's rights at the World Cup.
In an effort to galvanize soccer fans ahead of the match, and show the Iranian fans that their protests aren't in isolation, the YWCA started a campaign asking fans to chant "Woman, Life, Freedom!" in the stadium. The campaign is anchored by a video titled, "Don't let Iranians chant alone," which is currently making the rounds on social media, and shows the power of voices coming together in unison.
"We see the match as an opportunity to show Iranians they're not alone on the world stage," said Firoozeh Radjai, Director of Philanthropy, YWCA Toronto. "The things that are happening in Iran are not unique to the country: Old men in cloaks are deciding the fate of women all over the world based on clumsy interpretations of religious texts. Whether it's women in Iran demanding regime change, or women in Texas fighting for abortion rights, the phrase "Woman, Life, Freedom" holds power everywhere."
You can watch and share the video here . The YWCA hopes that soccer fans around the world won't let Iranian fans chant alone by sharing the video and urging World Cup attendees to join in on the chant.

SINGAPORE, Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Many billions worth of crypto assets have evaporated on FTX, the world's third-largest exchange. But history repeats itself. As of 2014, it was Mt. Gox, the world's largest Bitcoin broker and the world's leading Bitcoin exchange, handling more than 70% of all Bitcoin transactions worldwide in February 2014, exchange was hacked and 850,000 bitcoins were stolen. This was a systematic and infrastructure failure.
There is low education on handling private keys and personal wallets. Challenges for crypto investors seem to be more about how not to "lose" than "make a profit."
Therefore, to keep it safe, you should keep it in own wallet and private key or mnemonic that allows access to the generated wallet which must also be protected.
Private key or recovery word phrase cannot be recovered once it's lost. It gives access to different tokens. In most cases, combinations of 12 to 36 characters is kept insecurely. This also causes a risk of loss or getting hacked. Cold wallets (hardware) are an alternative but fall under the same circumstances. 
Master Key 2.0 has been released to protect crypto assets and private keys. The advantage is that it allows protection of wallet and crypto assets by securing private key in random incidents. Moreover, 3FA of personal authentication info can only be the access to protect and retrieve the private keys. 
In particular, one can manage multiple wallets and private keys of various crypto assets at once. Only owners can utilize their personal information to manage the keys that allow them to access assets on the blockchain. All private keys protected by 3FA are algorithmically encrypted and kept segregated in secure storage in the Microsoft cloud. Restoration and Recovery follows the same procedure. It's easy and convenient, but it also provides very strong encryption and a reliable cloud architecture. MasterKey's encryption and algorithm services are provided as API to partner with B2B. It servers wallet provider and Defi exchanges. You can access and download at: https://www.the-masterkey.com
MasterKey 2.0, is offered by Digifinance Pte. Ltd. in Singapore. Digifinance aims to build the premier digital wealth technology platform offering holistic investment and security services across the full digital assets spectrum. The company has partnership with Samsung, UNESCO, r3, KOSCOM(Korea Exchange) and others, and has been awarded by Microsoft Startup.

Experience it firsthand at Food Ingredients Europe, stand 4C180, in Paris, December 6-8
COPENHAGEN, Denmark and ATLANTA, Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Ingredient powerhouses CP Kelco and Chr. Hansen are proud to offer customers a collaboration combining their world-leading expertise and solutions to take consumer-friendly, shelf-stable, plant-based yogurt alternatives ("vegurts") to the next level.
Consumer demand for healthy and more sustainable food choices has driven an explosion in launches of plant-based alternatives to traditional dairy products. Within these categories, manufacturers and retailers have recognized the advantages of shelf-stable products, which can reduce food waste and increase geographical reach. For consumers, ambient-stable products offer convenience. However, to embrace regular consumption consumers are not ready to compromise on taste, nutrition, and the "naturalness" of shelf-stable, plant-based products. 
Industrially validated prototypes for oat, soy, pea, coconut and almond CP Kelco and Chr. Hansen have closely collaborated to demonstrate that production of nutritious and great-tasting, ambient, plant-based yogurt alternatives are possible for a variety of different plant bases. The result of this collaboration includes industrially validated prototypes of drinkable and spoonable vegurts with either oat, soy, pea, coconut or almond bases.
"The technological challenge to produce both spoonable and drinkable ambient vegurts with great nutrition, taste and texture is significant," said Christian Gilleladen, Principal Application Scientist at Chr. Hansen. "Selecting the right culture to provide fermentation performance, texture and flavor for each recipe, and having these complement the stabilization and flavor systems is critical to making great products."
Gilleladen continued, "By working together, we have been able to unlock the synergies between ingredients and process to produce a variety of desired thicknesses and mouthfeel."
"This collaboration represents a new way of helping our respective customers accelerate their product development and access technical application support globally," said Anne Sinha, Marketing Director at CP Kelco, on behalf of the two companies. "With access to teams who know each other and work together well, and who are closely connected to other global ingredient producers, customers can benefit from an integrated team of world-leading experts with insights across their entire development chain."
Prototype recipes can be customized To date, a range of vegurt prototypes are available to food producers for tasting, and they have received positive feedback from select customers. The prototype recipes can be tweaked to meet specific requirements for sugar, protein, fat, texture and flavor, thanks to the comprehensive expertise in fermentation, stabilization, flavor, processing and packaging offered by the collaboration.
"Formulating plant-based vegurts is not straightforward, and we want to help our customers to be best in class by offering our joint technical expertise," said Tora Jorn, Sales Technical Service Manager at CP Kelco. "Together, we look forward to this opportunity of sharing our support and helping with the development of the flavors, textures and nutritional profiles our customers are targeting when they embark on the plant-based, shelf-stable vegurts journey."
The vegurts will be available for tasting at CP Kelco stand 4.C180 at Food Ingredients Europe (FIE) in Paris, December 6-8.

New S&P Global Commodity Insights model provides unprecedented granularity to understand the variations in greenhouse gas intensity on an asset-to-asset level
LONDON, Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- A new analysis of North Sea oil and gas production by S&P Global Commodity Insights illustrates the degree that greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity can vary from one oil and gas asset to the next, and the factors that ultimately determine it.
The average GHG intensity of production in the UK and Norwegian areas of the North Sea was 12 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel of oil equivalent (kgCO 2 e/boe) in 2021. A deeper analysis revealed that nearly 2/3 of total production was found to have an intensity below that basin-wide average. Meanwhile, assets responsible for just 20 percent of total production generated half of the basin's total GHG emissions.
Overall, individual assets across the basin displayed a wide variability, ranging in GHG intensity from less than 1 kgCO 2 e/boe to nearly 150 kgCO 2 e/boe. Such a wide range is consistent across all the regions that have been explored to date and highlights the challenges of averages, the report finds. 
The findings are derived from a new S&P Global Commodity Insights capability that provides a novel and comprehensive approach to estimating upstream oil and gas production emissions. The new capability, built upon existing proprietary upstream databases and emerging sources such as reported emissions and satellite flaring data from the Earth Observation Group, makes it possible to estimate the totality of an upstream oil and gas play's emissions and emissions intensity—from across the play, down to individual assets and the sources of emissions, such as the fuels, that underpin each operation.
"In every play where we have looked, we continue to find wide variability in the greenhouse gas intensity with any one asset potentially being significantly different from the average," said Kevin Birn, Global Head for S&P Global Commodity Insights newly formed Centre of Emissions Excellence . "The new S&P Global Commodity Insights capability delivers a level of granularity that is essential for governments, investors, and frankly the market to truly understand the nature of upstream oil and gas emissions, down to individual assets and the drivers behind each assets emissions, such as fuels that get used."
The considerable variability of the findings illustrates several key factors that ultimately influence the GHG intensity of an asset. These include productivity, where younger and more productive fields tend to be less GHG intensive than older, more geologically challenging fields. The latter also may require energy-intensive enhanced recovery techniques, increased drilling to maintain productivity, and older technology can also put upward pressure on emissions intensity.
Other factors that impact the GHG intensity of individual assets include the degree to which operations can be electrified and the degree of venting and flaring.
"The scale and complexity of operations across the North Sea—a complex network of offshore platforms, drilling operations, subsea recovery units and pipelines—demonstrate how myriad factors influence the greenhouse gas intensity of any one asset," Christopher Kennett, associate director, S&P Global Commodity Insights . "The potential for wide variability makes understanding these factors at the asset-to-asset level all the more essential."
The S&P Global Commodity Insights analysis compared production in the United Kingdom and Norwegian areas of the North Sea to illustrate the influence of these factors.
The analysis found that, on average, UK production in the North Sea was nearly 3 times more GHG intensive (23 kgCO 2 e/boe) than Norwegian production (8 kgCO 2 e/boe).
Norwegian operations were advantaged on a GHG intensity basis as, on average, fields tended to be less mature and with a greater share of output from larger, more productive, and technologically advanced operations. Additionally, Norway benefited from electrification projects that tie back to Norway's relatively low-emission, hydro-dominated power grid.
By comparison, UK North Sea output tended to come from smaller, more mature or more geologically challenging fields, as well as from fields with older infrastructure and technology. These factors resulted in lower productivity and thus higher GHG intensity, the analysis finds. UK operations also had wider use of flaring—flaring and venting accounted for 28% of total UK North Sea emissions compared to 9% for Norway—and, unlike Norway, did not benefit from electrification projects to offset emissions from fuel combustion.
"With the acceleration of global ambition to tackle climate change, there is increasing need by market participants to better understand the GHG competitiveness of oil and gas assets globally," Birn said. "S&P Global Commodity Insights is supporting this process by shedding new light and understanding on the true nature of upstream GHG emissions at an unprecedented level of granularity."

Full text: COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 27, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Want to learn how to open a coffee shop in Utah? Get tips on starting a profitable business in The Beehive State from the coffee shop startup experts at Crimson Cup Coffee & Tea.
Through its 7 Steps to Success coffee shop startup program, Roast magazine's 2016 Macro Roaster of the Year has taught over 300 entrepreneurs in 30 states how to open their own independent coffee businesses.
Now, the company's 7 Steps coffee shop startup consulting team has added to its series of state-level coffee shop startup guides with, "How to Start a Coffee Shop in Utah."
"Utah is a terrific place to start a coffee shop!" said Crimson Cup Founder and President Greg Ubert.
"In fact, Utah ranks 18th among the states in the number of coffee shops per capita, with fewer than one coffee shop for every 5,595 residents. That leaves a lot of Utahns without a local coffee shop."
The program is based on Ubert's book, Seven Steps to Success: A Common-sense Guide to Succeed in Specialty Coffee, which he wrote to help customers develop profitable businesses by mastering all aspects of successful coffee shop operations.
"We help entrepreneurs with little or no coffee experience become owners of thriving coffee shops serving their local communities," he said.
"From choosing a terrific location and writing a strong coffee shop business plan to buying and laying out equipment, hiring and training staff and more, our team is here to guide you."
To hear about the book in Ubert's own words, download a free recorded introduction on Soundcloud.
Besides the Utah guide, Crimson Cup recently published guides on How to Start a Coffee Shop in Texas, Ohio, North Carolina, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Tennessee, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Virginia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Connecticut, New Jersey, Iowa, Alabama, Maine, Arkansas, Vermont, Rhode Island and Alaska.
The roaster will continue to post a state-level guide each week until all 50 states are covered.
"Although the fundamentals of coffee shop operation remain the same from state to state, the economic opportunities, business formation and licensing requirements vary widely," Ubert said. "We're excited to share information and resources to help entrepreneurs expedite their startup journey."
He invited anyone who is thinking of opening a coffee shop in any state to call Crimson Cup for guidance.
"If you run into any roadblocks or just want to discuss your vision with a coffee expert, you can reach our startup team by calling 1-888-800-9224."

ROSEN, A TOP RANKED FIRM, Encourages U.S. Bancorp Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - USB

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 27, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --
WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) between August 1, 2019 and July 28, 2022, both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"), of the important December 27, 2022   lead plaintiff deadline .
SO WHAT:  If you purchased U.S. Bancorp securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.
WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the U.S. Bancorp class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=9420 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than December 27, 2022 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bancorp's banking subsidiary) created sales pressure on its employees that led them to open credit cards, lines of credit, and deposit accounts without consumers' knowledge and consent; (2) since at least 2015, U.S. Bank National Association and by extension, U.S. Bancorp, was aware of such unauthorized conduct that it was violating relevant regulations and laws aimed at protecting its consumers; (3) U.S. Bancorp failed to properly monitor its employees from engaging in such unlawful conduct, detect and stop the misconduct, and identify and remediate harmed consumers; (4) all the foregoing subjected the Company to a foreseeable risk of heightened regulatory scrutiny or investigation; (5) U.S. Bancorp's revenues were in part the product of unlawful conduct and thus unsustainable; and (6) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
To join the U.S. Bancorp class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=9420 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.
No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

After refocusing its activities around insurance distribution and carrying out an in-depth transformation of its business model since its acquisition by CVC Capital Partners in 2019, enabling the group to return to a high level of performance, the APRIL Group announces that it has signed a long-term strategic partnership with global investment firm KKR. By teaming up with KKR, APRIL, which is already one of the leading insurance brokers in Europe, is preparing to accelerate its development and digitalization in the markets for borrowers, health and personal protection, niche property and casualty, international health insurance and wealth management in France and internationally.
PARIS and LYON, France , Nov. 26, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- With a turnover of €544 million in 2021, double-digit growth dynamics for 2022 and a nearly 20-point rise in its NPS, the APRIL Group has completed its transformation, achieving its objectives more than a year in advance. Building on this upward trajectory and its position as the French leader in wholesale insurance, the group has decided to take its ambitions to the next level and secure the means to become a key player at an international level.
To support this new stage of growth, the APRIL Group will now be supported by KKR, which, as a majority shareholder, will bring its global expertise in insurance and financial services.
The transaction will be subject to the usual legal and regulatory approvals.
"The APRIL Group was created 35 years ago by a visionary entrepreneur. After a great collaboration with CVC Capital Partners, April recovered its original strength. Our aim is to continue the history of this great company and to make it a French champion on a global scale. This next chapter will be enabled by the management team, our 2,300 employees, and KKR, for the benefit of our partners and policyholders ," states Eric Maumy, President & CEO of APRIL Group.
Over the past 3 years, the APRIL Group has reinvented itself:
- Organic growth of +8% in 2021 thanks to substantial work on products in France and worldwide across all its markets - loan insurance, health / personal protection, casualty niche insurance, international medical insurance - and entering a new market, property insurance, through the acquisition of Magnacarta;
- Improvement in customer experience, as recognised by 24-point NPS;
- Returned to its position as an industry leader, with all actors mobilised around the liberalisation of the loan insurance market;
- Strengthened digital and technological capabilities, with the creation of the dedicated APRIL X hub and the acquisition of ELOA and Comparadise;
- 800 employees recruited in 3 years;
- International expansion, with offices opened in Germany and Dubai.

(NasdaqGS: PYPL), if they purchased the Company's shares between February 3, 2021 and February 1, 2022, inclusive (the "Class Period").  This action is pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.
What You May Do
If you purchased shares of PayPal and would like to discuss your legal rights and how this case might affect you and your right to recover for your economic loss, you may, without obligation or cost to you, contact KSF Managing Partner Lewis Kahn toll-free at 1-877-515-1850 or via email (lewis.kahn@ksfcounsel.com), or visit https://www.ksfcounsel.com/cases/nasdaqgs-pypl/ to learn more. If you wish to serve as a lead plaintiff in this class action, you must petition the Court by December 5, 2022 .
About the Lawsuit
PayPal and certain of its executives are charged with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws. 
On February 1, 2022, the Company disclosed that its net new active accounts figure ("NNAs") was only 49 million for 2021, less than the guidance of 50 million it initially provided in February 2021 and lower than the raised guidance it reiterated just months prior, that it had identified 4.5 million accounts believed to have been illegitimately created, and that, as a result, it would change focus to increasing active user engagement rather than cash account opening incentives, which would reduce its ability to maintain growth in its NNAs.
On this news, shares of PayPal plummeted $43.23 per share, or approximately 25%, from a close of $175.80 per share on February 1, 2022 to close at $132.57 per share on February 2, 2022.
The case is Defined Benefit Plan of the Mid-Jersey Trucking Industry and Teamsters Local 701 Pension and Annuity Fund v. PayPal Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 22-cv-05864.

PORTSMOUTH, N.H., Nov. 25, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --
Jimmy's Jazz & Blues Club Features GRAMMY® Award-Winning Producer, Guitarist & Singer JOHN PIZZARELLI on Thursday December 15 at 8 P.M. World-Renowned Jazz Guitarist John Pizzarelli has been hailed by the BOSTON GLOBE for "reinvigorating the Great American Songbook and re-popularizing jazz."
"It's his guitar playing that truly places him in a class of his own" While plenty of jazz greats influenced his work—Benny Goodman, Les Paul, Zoot Sims, Clark Terry and Slam Stewart, among others—Nat King Cole has been Pizzarelli's hero and foundation over the last 25+ years. He devoted two albums to Nat King Cole music, 'Dear Mr. Cole' in 1994 and 'P.S. Mr. Cole', recorded and released five years later.
Established as one of the prime contemporary interpreters of the Great American Songbook, Pizzarelli has expanded that repertoire by including the music of Paul McCartney, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Tom Waits, Antonio Carlos Jobim and the Beatles.
"A rare entertainer of the old school"
— THE SEATTLE TIMES
"The genial genius of the guitar"
— THE TORONTO STAR
"The music is, as always, magnificent; the singing is, as always, exceptional"
— THE HUFFINGTON POST
"It's his guitar playing that truly places him in a class of his own"
— THE NEW YORKER
Pizzarelli's solo recording career started in 1990 where played clubs and concert halls on the jazz circuit, opening for such greats as Dave Brubeck, Ramsey Lewis and Rosemary Clooney. In 1993, he was honored to open for Frank Sinatra's international tour and then joined in the celebration for his 80th birthday at Carnegie Hall, bringing down the house singing "I Don't Know Why I Love You Like I Do" with his father accompanying him.
In 2006, he introduced 'Dear Mr. Sinatra', John's tribute album set to "Ol' Blue Eyes," featuring the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra. The collection features John Clayton's clever reworking of standards such as "I've Got You Under My Skin" and "You Make Me Feel So Young," as well as songs written for Sinatra, "Ring-A-Ding-Ding!," "Nice and Easy" and "The Last Dance." The NEW YORK TIMES praised the recording for "exploding with enthusiasm and excitement."
Pizzarelli's 2008 recording, the GRAMMY® Award Nominated 'With a Song in My Heart' album, celebrates the music of composer Richard Rodgers and includes swinging Rodgers & Hart standards like "The Lady Is a Tramp," "Mountain Greenery" and "Johnny One Note" and theater songs from South Pacific and The King and I. The singer-guitarist's first-ever Duke Ellington recording, 'Rockin' in Rhythm', was released in February 2010. For the dozen tracks, Pizzarelli took the tack of Ellington, noticeably displaying the strengths of the musicians in the band. Pizzarelli received the 2009 Ella Fitzgerald Award from the Montreal International Jazz Festival, joining a select group of past winners including Aretha Franklin, Tony Bennett, Etta James, Diana Krall, and Harry Connick Jr.
Pizzarelli has married songs from great pop songwriters of his own generation with traditional jazz arrangements and melodies. 'Double Exposure', released in 2012, united the Beatles and Lee Morgan, Tom Waits with Billy Strayhorn and the Allman Brothers Band with the style of Wes Montgomery. The GUARDIAN, UK was among the many publications to praise the album: "The arrangements are sharp and witty, the singing deceptively easygoing, and the guitar playing just terrific. It's a delight."
Pizzarelli's 'Midnight McCartney' album had its origins in Paul McCartney's GRAMMY® Award-Winning 2012 album, 'Kisses on the Bottom'. Pizzarelli played guitar on 10 of the album's 14 tracks and backed Sir Paul at an iTunes concert at Capitol Records Studios, the GRAMMY® Awards and the Recording Academy's annual MusiCares Person of the Year Gala. Fifteen months after those gigs, Paul McCartney wrote to Pizzarelli to consider recording some of his lesser-known songs in a jazz style. Pizzarelli's 'Midnight McCartney' album hit a new chart high for John, reaching #4 on Billboard's Jazz Albums Chart.
John was a co-producer of the James Taylor album 'American Standard', which won a GRAMMY® Award in the category of "Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album" on November 24, 2020.

Full text: LONDON, Nov. 25, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pure IP, a leading provider in SIP-based enterprise voice communications, has been successful in being approved as a supplier on Crown Commercial Service's (CCS) G Cloud framework following the latest refresh process. The most recent version of the framework, G Cloud 13, replaces G-Cloud 12 as the UK's digital marketplace for selling cloud solutions and services to the public sector.
"We're proud to continue as a supplier on G Cloud 13, a programme that's ensuring public sector access to the best cloud solutions on the market, at the best value for money," noted Gary Forrest, CEO at Pure IP.  "We have several customers in the public sector delivering vital public services and look forward to supporting more as they migrate their telephony to the cloud. For the public sector, cloud technologies are key to operating with more flexibility to support the hybrid workforce and crucially, moving telephony away from on-premises and traditional services has significant cost savings."
CCS supports the public sector to achieve maximum commercial value when procuring common goods and services. Over £1.5 billion, an average of £150 million each year, has been accrued in commercial benefits over the lifetime of the G-Cloud agreement, representing significant savings for the public purse.
This latest iteration will see the introduction of a fourth lot for further competition for cloud support services for larger, more complex requirements. In addition, the call-off term across the agreement has changed to 36 months with an optional 12-month extension.
The CCS also announced that G-Cloud 13 will now be accessible through a new digital Contract Award Service (CAS) to enable a better experience for customers. CAS will support future iterations of G-Cloud in an agile manner, as well as eventually digitally enabling all CCS agreements across our broad portfolio. The aim of this digital enablement is to provide customers (buyers and suppliers), with a full end to end digital procurement experience. 
With the latest refresh of G-Cloud-13, public sector organisations will be able to procure a range of Pure IP's services, including:
- Our full range of Managed Voice services for SIP, Teams (using Operator Connect and Direct Routing) and Zoom
- Our Contact Centre Connect offering to add voice to a range of Contact Centre applications
- SIP connect for legacy and analogue infrastructures
- SBC managed service for geographic extension in those hard-to-reach regions
- Number Connect, our Number Management solution
- Azure Communications solutions, for adding calling to the likes of Dynamics 365
- And Teams enablement and Management services

Pure IP's secure, reliable SIP based voice network, combined with unrivalled global coverage, a vendor-neutral solution that is easily integrated, and a technical-led 24/7 follow-the-sun support team provides a modular, flexible solution that can meet customer requirements and ensures they get maximum value and return on their investment.

Full text: DENISON, Texas, Nov. 25, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Texas native, lawyer, and author Mike Ledbetter recently highlighted the crucial importance of educating the public about important political topics like setting term limits for the Supreme Court of the United States. In addition to announcing his upcoming Presidential candidacy in 2024, Mike is offering free downloadable copies of his new book: "Nine Sovereign Kings: The Return of God" to each and every American. Filled with inspirational pictures while exploring a wide variety of important issues facing the country, "Nine Sovereign Kings" is a divine mandate for a new age – a guidebook in an ongoing spiritual war for the very heart of the nation.
" The 'Beloved Creator' of our Declaration of Independence has 'Inspired' me to write this book for all our 'People', all our 'Families' and 'Children!' That is why it is also 'Completely Free' to everyone in our 'Beloved Nation!' For our Creator asked me to let it be that way! And so you know it really is our Creator, our Trinity God, 'They' have 'Instructed' me to let all of you know that 'They' will 'Appear' even now to each person to confirm it! For that is our Creator's way to let us know it is Him, He loves us, and is here to help!"
Along with helpful illustrations, charts, and pictures , the text of the book is written in a specific manner to "make full use of the capitalization rule that states a word may be capitalized to emphasize it for some reason even if the English rules of capitalization say it is not to be" … "the Book was not written to meet all the rules of capitalization of our English language but to stress and emphasize such words as Freedom, Truth, the People, the States, Democracy, and our Republican Federation in our Spiritual War, along with other words that are capitalized here for 'Importance' and 'Emphasis' ..."
The above having been shared, one must ask , "Is this really our Creator, our Trinity God, who has 'Inspired' the writing of this 'Book' for all the 'American People?'" If our Creator 'Appeared' to you, as the 'Author' said He would above, then we all know that answer! Yes, it is really the 'Creator of our Declaration of Independence' who helped us, as 'The Thirteen American Colonies,' against all odds, defeat the 'Most Powerful Kingdom and Army' on the 'Face of the Earth' at that time, the 'Kingdom of England!'
From 'Nine Sovereign Kings': The Founding Fathers' Dream and Oversight
"This Book is, therefore, about the 'Dream' our Founding Fathers hoped to achieve. The 'Dream' they wished for themselves, their families, and their descendants. And what was that 'Dream'? It was the 'Dream' of 'True Freedom.' In other words, our Forefathers explored – for the first time in the history of the World – the uncharted waters of 'Federalism' and 'Constitutional Democracy.'"

LISHUI, China, Nov. 25, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- CN Energy Group. Inc. (NASDAQ: CNEY) today announced that its 6 th -generation gasification reactors (FLS-VI) have been formally and smoothly put into full operation at its Tahe Factory, after completing all acceptance checks on design requirements and passing all tests on safety, efficiency and reliability. This is a crucial achievement of CNEY's own R&D team that started in May 2020 to revamp and optimize its 5 th -generation gasification reactors (FLS-V). The first prototype of FLS-VI was built and installed in September 2021. This was followed by continuous on-site efforts on debugging shortcomings and enhancing performance, which lasted for 14 months of trial operations. In 2023, applications of FLS-VI gasification reactors are expected to be replicated on a large scale within CNEY's production lines.
Through such technological innovations and engineering progressions, CNEY has attained multifaceted improvements and consequently reinforced its competitive strength in the market. First, the daily outputs of carbonized materials per gasification reactor have increased by five times, from 4 tons for FLS-V to 20 tons for FLS-VI. Second, reactor automation has been ameliorated and streamlined so that the total number of workers needed to produce the same targeted level of outputs can be reduced by nearly two-thirds. Third, the entire production process has become more resource-conserving and environmentally friendly. Electricity and water inputs needed to produce each ton of activated carbon have been reduced by 1.5% and by 3%. Finally, the overall conversion rate from feedstocks to final products has also been boosted, with tangible quality enrichments.
CNEY's CEO, Dr. Kangbin Zheng, said: "We have been constantly striving to achieve engineering excellence, through developing our own intellectual property rights and forging better ways to serve our clients and to protect our environment. With a new generation of innovative and effective gasification reactors, we can produce refined products with higher quality and lower costs. This will create win-win solutions for all stakeholders, including our end users and shareholders."

Full text: - Comprehensive Analysys Mason study spans 15 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America
- Potential GDP economic benefits vastly outweigh investment costs
- Governments, regulators and policy makers play a key enabling role
- Countries also set to benefit from environmental and social inclusion capabilities

STOCKHOLM, Nov. 25, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- A major new Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) commissioned study by management consulting firm Analysys Mason highlights the potential economic, consumer and environmental benefits of 5G connectivity in 15 national emerging markets. With regulatory and government support, all fifteen countries could benefit from GDP growth between 0.3 and 0.46 percent through 2035, with an estimated three-to-seven-fold cost-to-benefit ratio.
Called the Future Value of Mobile in Emerging Markets, the report examines the impact of multiple 5G spectrum deployment options to facilitate enhanced mobile broadband and fixed wireless access (FWA) across consumer, industry, logistics, rural and public services clusters, and spanning several business case options, including verticals.   
The detailed methodology included using national government statistics and reports, Ericsson network insights and innovative mapping techniques - based on population density distribution and existing national infrastructure such as, road and rail networks, and agriculture - to create a cost-to-benefit model across the different deployment options.
Deployment options are based on the starting assumption of having 5G baseline rollout added to existing mobile radio network sites. Additional options explore the extra benefits of adding Low-Band 5G spectrum coverage beyond the baseline (delivering wider geographical coverage at the lower end of 5G capabilities and suited to agriculture or logistics deployments) or Mid-Band 5G spectrum coverage - delivering smaller geographical coverage per site, but with higher capacity and speed, suitable for manufacturing, automation, industry and advanced services.
Expanded Mid-Band 5G coverage is identified as the key success factor - with the potential to deliver about 80 percent of the economic benefits. Benefits from the Smart Industry and Smart Rural clusters account for 85-90 percent of the total economic benefits in each emerging market.
Agriculture is a significant sector in all 15 countries - accounting for up to 10 percent of GDP in some markets. The report estimates that enhanced rural 5G coverage could deliver up to 1.8 percent uplift in long-term GDP from agriculture. 5G will also promote sustainable farming methods, increase efficiency and reduce agricultural waste.
Study findings include: 
- Baseline 5G deployment cost is estimated between USD 3-8 billion per country. An additional 20-35 percent investment is required to extend coverage
- Extending coverage beyond the baseline can generate significant GDP benefits from industrial adoption, especially from mid-band coverage extension
- Most countries are expected to generate overall economic benefits (GDP) three-to-seven times higher than the incremental cost of extending coverage
- Results suggest 5G mobile broadband can generate consumer surplus between USD 1-10 billion per country, with coverage extension giving 20-30 percent extra consumer surplus
- The social benefits enabled by 5G will be greatest from 5G-based FWA, smart factories, freight and logistics, agriculture and healthcare use cases
- Adopting 5G can help reduce emissions by supporting digital transformation in agriculture, freight and logistics, smart factories and construction

The study highlights how governments, regulators and policy makers can support the 5G ecosystem to deliver the benefits.
These include treating 5G as a national infrastructure with a 5G national strategy and roadmap; implementing 5G spectrum policies that facilitate speedier and widespread deployment, including trading off spectrum fees for deployment targets that meet connectivity policy objectives; implementing policies and procedures to make infrastructure deployment and site upgrades easier; working with communications services providers to enhance coverage in areas where commercially-led solutions are not viable; incentivizing the use and prominence of 5G in industry and manufacturing; promoting 5G in the public sector and promoting the environmental benefits of 5G solutions.
Andrew Lloyd, Head of Government and Policy Advocacy, Ericsson, says: "This Analysys Mason Future Value of Mobile in Emerging Markets report provides a detailed breakdown, based on comprehensive research into realistic and achievable scenarios in each of the 15 countries, of the potential economic, social, environmental and national benefits of 5G in these markets. With the backing of governments, regulators and policy makers, each of these 15 countries, and their citizens, stand to benefit significantly from 5G connectivity. In addition to economic benefits, 5G can also reduce climate impact, increase social inclusion, wellbeing and tackle the digital divide in areas where fixed infrastructure availability is poor."
Janette Stewart, Partner, Analysys Mason, says: "The study highlights the benefits from having the right spectrum available for 5G deployment, both for geographic coverage, for which the low-bands are very suitable, and in the 3.5GHz band where most of the high-capacity 5G deployments in other markets are already taking place."
The countries addressed in the report research are Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey.

The value of esports is especially prevalent at the post-secondary level for student development, recruitment, and retention.
TORONTO, Nov. 24, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - Esports is an activity where video games are played competitively by professionals and is a growing trend in the education sector. Esports is popular among a wide range of students, including those that may not be interested in traditional sports and may otherwise see little extra-curricular involvement on campus. As many professionals and IT teams in education may be unfamiliar with esports, Global IT research and advisory firm Info-Tech Research Group has published a new industry blueprint titled Develop and Mature an Esports Program in Education  to address this emerging opportunity.
Within education, esports is considered a full K-20 activity, with the potential to span the entire academic journey of most students. For universities, developing ties with local high schools via esports can also offer a recruitment channel through scholarship programs to find students with high academic potential. As well, esports can have a positive impact and improve student retention for the following reasons:
1.      Many students are engaged in esports.
2.      Many gamers are not yet otherwise engaged on campuses.
3.      Esports can offer multiple points of entry, creating a very diverse group
Esports often develops in an ad-hoc fashion, but without a coherent plan it is difficult to identify initiatives that should be taken and at what time. Info-Tech's resource explains that although IT will often be involved in the development of an esports program due to the technical nature of its foundation, many within IT and elsewhere in the school, college, or university are unfamiliar with the esports space. 
"Despite the lack of physical activity, esports has substantial similarities with traditional sports," says Mark Maby, research director at Info-Tech Research Group .   "This includes its focus on team collaboration and the range of participation, from casual gamers to competitive   'athletes' and spectators. These similarities mean that the school or college can leverage their existing athletics expertise to support esports."
Info-Tech's research indicates that the concept of esports has the potential to be as popular as traditional sports and can help develop and support essential life skills.
"The key difference is the technology, and IT is often centrally involved in the development and governance of esports,"  explains Maby.  "Info-Tech's research provides the IT department with information on the growth of esports in education, and on how an esports program typically matures. It also helps IT navigate and mature the esports initiative at their district or institution."  
Although adoption is still in the early stages and lacks governance of traditional sports, by leveraging a maturity model, an esports program can benefit educational institutions while minimizing esports' drawbacks and mitigating organizational challenges.

MONTREAL, Nov. 24, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - The CSL Group ("CSL") is delighted to announce that former CSL President and CEO, and current Board member, Rod Jones, was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award on Monday evening, during the International Bulk Journal ("IBJ") Awards in Rotterdam, Netherlands.
"Respected throughout the global marine transportation industry, Rod Jones stands out as an inclusive, accessible and modern leader with solid ethics and values around diversity, safety and the environment," said Ray Girvan, Publisher, International Bulk Journal.
"His open-mindedness, strong belief in people and drive to 'do the right thing' continue to inspire people at every level of the industry, both on board and at shore, regardless of age, gender, nationality and role."
Mr. Jones has devoted his entire professional life to the shipping world. His early shore-side shipping career took him through various roles at Navios Corporation and Van Ommeren Shipping. In 1985, he joined Canada Steamship Lines as Marketing Director and eventually became President of CSL International in the early 1990s, and then President and CEO of The CSL Group in 2008 until his retirement in 2017.
Mr. Jones' passion for shipping extends to The Standard Club, where he was appointed to the Board in 2000. In 2011, he was elected Chair of the Audit Committee and, later became Chair of the Club from 2014 to 2017.
During his tenure at CSL, Mr. Jones transformed the Great Lakes-focused business into the largest owner and operator of self-unloading ships in the world. Under his leadership, CSL has expanded far beyond Canada and the Americas to Australia, Asia and Europe. 
"When I started in the shipping industry as a deckhand, the world was a different place. I was young and did not foresee that when I walked up that gangway for the first time, I would be enmeshed in marine shipping for the next 50 years," said Rod Jones.
"It has been a blast to work within this global industry and to have been part of CSL, a remarkable company committed to safe and environmentally sound operations, innovation and customer service. I am truly honoured to receive this award and thank IBJ, the CSL team, and most of all, my wife and family."
The CSL Group is the largest owner and operator of self-unloading ships in the world. Headquartered in Montreal with regional operations throughout the world, CSL delivers millions of tonnes of cargo annually for customers in the construction, steel, energy and agri-food sectors.

CHANGSHA, China, Nov. 24, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- On November 22 to 24, the first Changsha Tourism Development Conference is held in the Wangcheng district of Changsha. The event mainly compasses four main activities including the forum for investment promotion and integrated development of culture and tourism for the cultural and tourism industries of Changsha, project reviews, tourism industry promotion conferences, and cultural tourism promotions as well as nine supplementary activities. These resourceful activities will be carried out on-line and off-line and are expected to attract attention.
As a highly popular destination having gained influence on social media in recent years, Changsha, with its rich cultural legacy, is riding the wave by deeply tapping into its enriched tourism resources, according to the Publicity Department of Changsha City. The city has made great progress in building itself as a comprehensive transportation hub within the country and has kept drawing in high-quality cultural and creativity resources from home and abroad, showing such aspirations to create a cultural industrial cluster that will have international influence, establish a national cultural export base, and to set a new example for foreign cultural trade.
Before the conference, the slogan "Merry Life in Changsha, Start City Shinning Bright" and the newly designed logo for publicizing the city's cultural tourism were released. The slogan has connoted a particular idea of "merriness", the curiosity about "shining bright", and the love for the "star city" in the new era, with a new look.
The conference will be in full swing to attract foreign businesses, bring in investment, and ripen projects. During the forum for investment promotion and integrated development of culture and tourism for these two industries, contracts of 15 major projects (including those with intention) with a total value of 26.066 billion yuan will be signed.
With the support of Mr. Shan Jixiang, chairman of China Cultural Relics Academy, Mr. Wang Han, the famous Hunan TV program host, and Ms. Zuo Xiaoqing, the well-known actress, all of whom are new ambassadors for cultural tourism of Changsha, the whole city will be mobilized to enlarge the popularity of Changsha as a great tourist destination, forming a synergy of efforts to promote tourism by everyone in the city and giving a lively social atmosphere.

ZUG, Switzerland, Nov. 24, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Sensorium's Deputy CEO and Art Director, Sasha Tityanko will be taking part as a headline speaker at the upcoming XP Music Futures , set to take place in Riyadh between Nov. 28-30.
Billed as the most forward-thinking gathering of music leaders held in the Middle East, XP Futures is a premier destination for established artists, producers, executives and music icons as well as exciting new talent from across the world.
Sasha will be delivering a keynote speech on the topic of "Music and Web3: How Virtual Artists & Beings Change The Game In The AI-driven Metaverse" on Nov. 29, alongside Sensorium's visual collective act SVORA. During the talk, she will delve deeper and explore hot topics for the music industry, including the paradigm shift being brought on by emerging technology, the potential of Web3, the role of AI in music creation and opportunities unlocked by metaverse for performers, producers and fans.
"This event is an opportunity for industry leaders to get together and discuss ways to improve the music ecosystem across the Middle East and beyond, while also helping us identify the agents of change that will shape the future of the music landscape for years to come. As we're living through a fundamental shift in the industry, with the increasing role of emerging technologies re-drawing the limitations of what can be done and experienced, I believe that having this conversation now can lead to massive impact", notes Sasha Tityanko.
In addition, Sasha will be taking part in a panel dedicated to exploring the issue of "Rave in the New World: Web3 and the Metaverse".
XP Futures is being organized by MDLBEAST, the first-ever organization dedicated to enhancing the music and event sector in Saudi Arabia.
This year's edition will be hosting the likes of music executive and artist manager Mathew Knowles, Palestinian-Chillean superstar Elyanna, artist, and Saudi Arabia's first female DJ Cosmicat, amongst many others.
The conference's sessions will be held under XP's four vital blocks which are talent, impact, scene, and innovation.
"Sensorium is unleashing the power of creative communities and elevating the music world to the next level. Bringing down physical barriers, Sensorium is allowing artists, fans, and event organizers to come together in one endless world, setting the stage for the future of the music scene. For someone who has dedicated his life to working in music, it really does feel like the future is now," added Nour Said, A&R and Product Manager at MDLBEAST.
XP Futures also serve as a warm-up to the MDLBEAST's SOUNDSTORM Festival (taking place 1-3 December), which has become one of the world's leading electronic music festivals.
Last year's SOUNDSTORM welcomed more than 730,000 attendees and in 2022 it will be gathering over 150 world-renowned electronic music artists.
The festival's lineup includes many of Sensorium Galaxy's Chosen Ones such as Carl Cox, David Guetta, Eric Prydz, Steve Aoki, and Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike.
As part of the festival's effort to expand across music genres beyond EDM, organizers have tapped a number of crossover artists, including Post Malone, DJ Khaled, Chet Faker and Bruno Mars.
Sensorium's participation in this series of events comes on the heels of the company's expansion efforts in the Middle East, having announced last month plans to launch a branch in Dubai as the region provides a sustainable and supportive framework for metaverse companies.

HANGZHOU, China, Nov. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Recently, Rokid, an augmented reality glasses manufacturer,  partnered with Eyedaptic to unveil the all-new EYE5 smart glasses at the American Academy of Optometry 2022 Annual Meeting and Expo. The latest model brings wearability to a whole new level and covers the widest range of use cases for central vision loss including Diabetic Retinopathy and Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).
Equipped with simulated natural vision software, the Eyedaptic EYE5 solution optimizes the user's functional peripheral vision through a small embedded camera that captures an individual's environment, manipulates and enhances the pixels and re-displays the image.
The smart product includes novel artificial intelligence and computer vision algorithms, while its latest features integrate seamlessly with Eyedaptic's custom user interface. Furthermore, the EYE5 still offers the EyeSwitch 2-in-1 functionality combining a wearable and a hand-held visual aid all in one product, eliminating the need for multiple products for different scenarios.
With the availability of Eyedaptic wearables, patients with retinal diseases can now be referred to solutions that enhance their quality of life, easily and unobtrusively.
Create a complete visual jigsaw to enjoy a whole world
From nano-robots to intelligent bionic hands, a growing number of technologies and achievements are prolonging human life. Patients with macular degeneration perceive the world as if a piece of it was covered by a black cloth, leaving a black hole of absence.
Eyedaptic develops visual aids for macular degeneration and other retinal diseases. The software, powered by Air Pro, an augmented reality hardware developed by Rokid, re-displays images from the user's surroundings after processing the images and enhancing the pixels, helping patients see their important surroundings .
Wearable technology is no longer just available for the tech-savvy. Eyedaptic's new eye5 is easier to use, lighter and more comfortable for anyone of any age suffering from central vision loss.
Restoring the clarity of colors
What does the world look like in the eyes of people with normal vision? Blue sky, white clouds, the invigorating autumn landscape, the fragrance of cinnamon in the air, clear and colorful scenery, full of life.
Eyes are the window to the soul. But for people with eye diseases, their vision is blurred, distorted, or obscured by black dots. The world in their eyes is crippled, and they have extreme difficulty when attempting to read, may be unable to travel, or even see their loved ones clearly.
According to the first World Vision Report recently released by the World Health Organization, the number of people worldwide with visual impairments or blindness surpasses 2.2 billion, while the number with macular degeneration is expected to increase from 195.6 million in 2020 to 243.3 million in 2030. With the changing demographics, more and more people will suffer from it.
"People value their eyesight over ten times more than any of their other senses. The EYE5 gives my patients with visual impairments access to life-changing technology that enhances their vision," said Dr. Mitul Mehta, MD Vitreo Retinal Surgeon and Eyedaptic's Chief Medical Officer.
Technology makes life better
Clinical studies have been conducted to demonstrate the utility and efficacy of the solution built by Eyedaptic and Rokid based on the Rokid Air Pro. The clinical data demonstrated over a doubling in visual acuity and a fivefold improvement in daily activities. It is ideal for those managing a wide variety of tasks whether it be seeing a movie, grocery shopping, or working at a computer.
Rokid is a product platform company focusing on product development of hardware and software for 5G, AI and AR applications. The firm combines cutting-edge Al and AR technologies with industry applications through multi-disciplinary research in speech recognition, natural language processing, computer vision, optical display, chip platform, and hardware design to provide full-stack solutions for customers in different verticals, creating super workers in the age of intelligence, enhancing the user experience and helping companies perform better.
With the mission to "leave nobody behind", Rokid empowers more people to enjoy a happy and wonderful life through technology.
The poet Gu Cheng once penned some verse that said, "I was given the dark eyes by the dark night, yet I use them to search for light." It is human nature to be in the pursuit of brightness. Advances in technology not only play a role as a physical function, but also makes it possible for more and more people to avoid struggling just to get through the day. The power of technology to make lives better is ultimately a miracle created by people. We believe in the infinite possibilities of life and cherish every moment of every day!

Full text: Monster Energy congratulates team rider Birk Ruud on taking first place in Men's Freeski Slopestyle at the FIS World Cup in Stubai, Austria.
STUBAI, Austria, Nov. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- The 2022/23 freeski slopestyle season has launched! Monster Energy congratulates team rider Birk Ruud on taking first place in Men's Freeski Slopestyle at the FIS World Cup in Stubai, Austria. In the first event of the season, sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS), the 22-year-old from Baerum, Norway covered the downhill course on Stubai Glacier with a perfect run to rise above the competition.
Also putting on a strong performance this weekend, Team USA rider and Monster Energy athlete Colby Stevenson rose to the podium: The 25-year-old from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, finished in third place on the strength of a technical run.
From November 16-19, 2022, the world elite of the sport headed to Stubai Glacier for the FIS Freeski World Cup. Once again, the world-class Stubai Zoo slopestyle course provided the backdrop for spectacular freestyle ski action. The sixth edition of the Stubai FIS World Cup attracted top riders, including Olympic gold medalists and X Games winners.
In the Men's Freeski Slopestyle Final, Monster Energy's Birk Ruud stepped in as a top competitor. Only a few weeks ago, the Olympic gold medalist clinched the win in the Freeski Big Air season opener in Switzerland. And as the overall 2021/22 FIS World Cup Crystal Globe winner – claiming three wins and four podiums in the past season – the Norwegian was looking to maintain his momentum.
Facing heat from Switzerland's Andri Ragettli, Ruud proceeded to lock in the win right on his first run. Hitting the two jumps with a switch right double cork 1620 safety and a left double bio 1440 mute, he worked the rail section with a right-side backside 810 off, followed by a switch left 270 back swap 360 to forward, and right 450 on to 270 pretzel out on the last obstacle. The powerful run earned Ruud a score of 88.96 points and what is already his tenth World Cup victory.
"To me, there are two things: To stay present and to have good preparations. Those are the only things that matter. If you ask me what's going through my mind when I ski, I would just say there's nothing. I'm completely present. I don't think about anything; I'm just right in the moment," said Monster Energy's Ruud after winning the Slopestyle season opener in Stubai.
Known as one of the most versatile freeskiers on the circuit, Monster Energy's Ruud earned the Olympic gold medal in Men's Ski Big Air at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and owns four X Games medals (2 gold, 2 silver).
A second Monster Energy rider earned a podium spot this weekend: Third place in Men's Freeski Slopestyle went to 25-year-old Colby Stevenson from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, but currently resides in Park City, Utah. Stevenson is no stranger to World Cup podiums and finished 2020/21 as the Crystal Globe winner.
In Stubai, the American prodigy returned to the World Cup podium for the first time since claiming the trophy. Trick highlights included a creative left nosebutter double 1620 revert Japan as well as a technical left corked 900 tail tap on the course's balloon feature. With a score of 85.68 points, Stevenson earned the third-place finish for Team USA.
Now a member of the US Ski Team for eight years, Stevenson barged into the spotlight with a breakout season performance in 2020. That year, he made history as the first X Games rookie to win slopestyle gold and also took top honors in the new Ski Knuckle Huck event at X Games Aspen. In 2021, he took first place in Slopestyle at Dew Tour Copper Mountain and took home the silver medal in Men's Ski Big Air at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic games.
Next on the calendar, look forward to ending the year with a bang: From 14-17 December, the FIS Freeski World Cup at Copper Mountain, Colorado, will host Big Air and Halfpipe competitions. Don't miss it!

Full text: Brent Jolly, CAJ president - 289-387-3179, brent@caj.ca
REGINA, SK, Nov. 23, 2022 /CNW/ - The Canadian Association of Journalists (CAJ) calls on the Government of Saskatchewan, and the province's minister of justice and attorney general, to withdraw its unnecessary application for a sweeping publication ban that would prevent journalists from reporting on the upcoming bail hearing for a pair of Saulteaux sisters in a possible wrongful conviction case .
Sisters Nerissa and Odelia Quewezance are scheduled to appear for a bail hearing in Yorkton, Sask. court on Nov. 24-25. Their case has drawn considerable attention in recent months after the Department of Justice's Criminal Conviction Review Group declared in June  that there "may be a reasonable basis to conclude that a miscarriage of justice likely occurred in this matter." David Lametti, the federal justice minister, has ordered an investigation into the convictions.
The sisters have spent about three decades in prison after they were sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of the second-degree murder of a local farmer, Joseph Anthony Dolff, in 1994. The sisters are seeking to be exonerated after the pair's cousin, Jason Kashane , pleaded guilty to killing Dolff. He was sentenced to five years in jail. 
If granted, the publication ban would also seal court records.
"In Canada, open courts and freedom of the press are foundational values that are embedded in our legal and cultural understanding of how effective systems should work," said CAJ president Brent Jolly.
"Imposing restrictions that institute a proverbial 'cone of silence' prevents the public from properly scrutinizing the merits of the case. This lack of transparency casts a dark shadow over the public's right to know. The court must ask itself: Whose rights would be protected by imposing this publication ban?"
In general, publication bans are orders made to protect the accused person(s) charter-protected right(s) to a fair and public trial. They are also used to ensure that victims, witnesses, and others are able to participate in judicial proceedings without suffering negative consequences.
The CAJ supports efforts by news organizations, including APTN  and the CBC , to challenge these orders to bear witness and keep the public informed.
"As a public trust, journalism must always shine a light on the ways in which our social fabric may be tattered, torn, or in need of repair," Jolly said. "Any effort to muzzle the media not only impinges on the pursuit of justice, as in this case, but it also speaks to the wider abuse of the systems of transparency and accountability in our society. Justice must be seen to be done."
The Canadian Association of Journalists is a professional organization with 1300 members across Canada. The CAJ's primary roles are public-interest advocacy work and professional development for its members.

Full text: Cosmic Wire, the Web3 solution, hired to create the most personal and engaging fan experience
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Group Sport has entered into an agreement to purchase Getafe Club de Fútbol S.A.D. (Getafe CF). The Madrid-based La Liga team is a mainstay in Spain's top-tier league, and with the purchase, Group Sport looks to make Getafe a leader in the future of professional sports worldwide.
Group Sport Announces Getafe CF Acquisition for its "Ownership Experience DAO" Group Sport will use its team's deep knowledge of European football to raise the level of on-field performance and, simultaneously, create a more profound fan experience for the community in Spain and worldwide. "Getafe is a diamond in the rough in La Liga and plays alongside some of the world's best teams in Madrid, one of the world's great football cities. We have big plans for Getafe and look forward to creating a tradition of excellence for the players and the fans in Madrid and around the world," says Javier Perez, Managing Partner of Group Sport. Piotr Nowak, Head of Football Operations at Group Sport, says, "We know there's a lot that can be built on the foundation created at Getafe. We will work with the coaches and players to build a team we can all be proud of in the coming years".
Group Sport has enlisted Cosmic Wire, the Web3 solution, to bring its vision to life by creating the most personal and engaging fan experience for international football lovers worldwide. Group Sport acquires sports teams and creates individual metaverses and representative DAOs for them. Through the DAO Group Sport blurs the lines of what it is to be a fan with exclusive access to the teams in the metaverse and real life. No matter where or who you are, you can be a part of the game, and be part of the team. As a member of the DAO, your decisions impact the club. You are also part of the club with exclusive elite access, private events, more profound experiences, and unique DAO member-only rewards.

"We are thrilled to empower Group Sport L.T.D. to execute their vision of the Ultimate Sports experience.

"Our partnership with Group Sport highlights our philosophy of a democratized space where content owners and creators can create their ecosystems to build equity in their platform. Group Sport has a vision, and we are excited to bring it to the world."
Highlights of Getafe CF: Officially founded on 24 February 1946, the club was named Club Getafe Deportivo. The club initially played in the Campo del Regimiento de Artillería, which lacked goalposts. In 2006–07, Getafe finished ninth in La Liga, conceding only 33 goals in 38 matches, and goalkeeper Roberto Abbondanzieri was awarded the Zamora Trophy, having recorded 12 clean sheets. The season's highlight was reaching the 2006–07 Copa del Rey final, a competition in which Getafe had never previously reached the quarter-finals. In the 2018–19 season, Getafe finished 5th, their highest finish in the first division, and qualified for the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League group stage. They progressed as far as the round of 16, where they lost to Inter Milan.

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Trustfeed's (OTC: TRFE) database is skyrocketing and set a new record with an increase to an astronomical 300 million companies listed on the Trustfeed.com review and rating platform. This huge increase of business listings is driven by Trustfeed's proprietary software that automatically retrieves and validates information from the Internet about any company in the world. All 300 million companies are expected to be fully updated by 1st quarter 2023, after which companies will be invited to take control of their profile and add additional information, images, logos, etc.
89% of consumers check reviews prior to purchasing. Our vision is that on Trustfeed.com you should be able to find trustworthy information and reviews on any business, anywhere, and at any time.
With a database of 300 million companies, Trustfeed should be able to take a unique position in the market for business reviews and ratings.
During December, companies will have the opportunity to get a sponsored listing in the search results of our webpage, which will cost from USD 59-189 per year for up to 10 keywords, on a first-come, first-served basis.
Compared to Trustfeed's 300 million companies, Yelp has approximately 5 million business listed and a Market cap of $2 billion.
Trustfeed will be lengths above Yelp and other major players in the market for business listings when it comes to information. "With this in mind, Trustfeed current market cap of around USD 140 is severely undervalued", says Rasmus Refer CEO of Trustfeed.

Full text: Aimee Ren, +86-18758338390
BEIJING, Nov. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- RLX Technology (NYSE: RLX), known for its RELX-branded e-vapor products, announced today that it has been upgrated to 'A' by MSCI ESG Rating, taking a dramatic leap from CCC last year, ranking ahead of global e-vapor peers.
MSCI ESG ratings measure the management of financially relevant ESG risks and opportunities over 8,500 companies and more than 680,000 equity and fixed income securities globally. .
The ESG rating represents the capital market's recognition of RLX's commitment to business ethics, responsible marketing, products safety and quality, supply chain labor standards, chemical safety and ESG key issues.
In addition to MSCI, RLX has recently achieved excellent results from a number of the world's leading ESG rating agencies. Morningstar Sustainalytics has improved RLX's ESG risk rating from 'high' to 'medium' in the tobacco industry, topping the chart among global e-vapor companies. RLX was also ranked first among its global e-vapor peers in the latest annual S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment.
RLX has always regarded ESG as part of the company's core competitiveness. It has established an ESG committee at the board level to develop sustainability strategies, aiming to comprehensively improve its ESG performance and ensure the implementation of relevant initiatives.
In MSCI's ESG rating, RLX has achieved relatively high recognition in product safety and quality. Since its inception, RLX has invested over RMB 800 million in research and development, forming a "1+4" science research chain covering product quality, physiochemical research, toxicology research, long-term impact assessment and clinical research, while establishing its laboratory matrix consisting of eight labs.
RLX is also committed to driving sustainable development along the entire value chain. RLX regularly conducts ESG performance assessments on existing suppliers. It also conducts the third-party audit on selected suppliers based on the RELX Code of Conduct for Business Partners and the SA8000 Standard.In the meantime, RLX advocates the concept of sustainable consumption, and encourages users to participate in the "Pods Reborn" recycling program to recycle used pods. The Pods Reborn recycling program has covered 188 cities across China by the end of June, 2022.
In April 2022, RLX also launched its net-zero emissions plan Aim for Zero to achieve carbon neutrality in its direct operations by 2033 and along the value chain by 2050.
Since 2021, RLX has started to disclose its environmental information on Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) including carbon emissions, climate change response strategies and climate change risk and opportunity assessments. CDP's environmental disclosure and scoring methodology is widely-recognized as the gold standard for corporate environmental transparency. In the future, RLX will share the progress and achievements on its decarbonization journey with investors and the global community on a regular basis.

Full text: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Viewers who tuned into the exciting season finale of ABC's hit show Bachelor in Paradise were treated to a stunning and surprising proposal. The gorgeous ring was designed by Hollywood's most celebrated designer and official jeweler of The Bachelor franchise, Neil Lane (neillanecouture.com).
After leaving Mexico broken-hearted when his proposal was rejected on Michelle Young's season of The Bachelorette , Brandon Jones took a second shot at love and got down on one knee to propose to Serene Russell with a stunning 18k rose gold diamond ring, centrally set with an emerald cut diamond further accented by 16 small round white diamonds and 8 fancy pink diamonds. Designed and signed by Neil Lane.
"Brandon and Serene's love story on Bachelor in Paradise was so special to witness," says Lane. "Although the design of Serene's ring is classic and contemporary, I chose to use rose gold with small pink diamond accents to give it a romantic and retro feel."
Bachelor in Paradise features some of The Bachelor franchise's biggest stars and breakout fan-favorites. They each left The Bachelor or The Bachelorette with a broken heart, but now, knowing what it really takes to find love, they'll get a second (or third) chance to find their soulmates. Living together in a dreamy oasis in Mexico, these hopeful romantics explore new relationships, fall in love, and experience heartbreak, all in search for "the one."
Neil Lane is the go-to jeweler for Hollywood brides-to-be. He has designed engagement rings for stars like Reese Witherspoon, Kate Hudson, Jennifer Hudson, Jessica Simpson, Emily Blunt and Miley Cyrus, among others, and shares his unique aesthetic with his Neil Lane Bridal® collection at Kay® Jewelers.
An avid collector and designer of fine jewelry with an eye for style and elegance, Neil Lane has earned the respect and admiration of A-list stars. From the Oscars®, to private celebrity events and red-carpet engagements, Neil Lane's iconic pieces have adorned some of the most beautiful and powerful women in Hollywood, including Angelina Jolie, Charlize Theron, Jennifer Lopez, Brie Larson, Anne Hathaway, Jennifer Lawrence, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Garner, Sofia Vergara, Oprah and many others.

Full text: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Mesothelioma Victims Center is appealing to the family of a person who has just been diagnosed with mesothelioma anywhere in the United States to not shortchange themselves for falling for internet advertising that makes it sound like all a person with this rare cancer has to do is fill out a claim form and a big check gets sent out right away. It does not work this way. There are a small number of amazing law firms in the nation that specialize in mesothelioma and The Gori Law Firm is one of them. If the family of a person with mesothelioma wants the best compensation results-it is vital they hire lawyers who know what they are doing.
The Gori Law Firm is responsible for over $3 billion dollars in compensation results for their clients-and every year more families trust The Gori Law Firm when dealing with a loved one's asbestos cancer diagnosis than any other firm in the nation as they are always happy to discuss at 866-532-2106. https://GoriLaw.com
The Mesothelioma Victims Center says, "The Gori Law Firm has in place a time proven system to ensure their clients who have mesothelioma receive the best possible compensation results. Within 24 hours of a person with mesothelioma and or their family calling The Gori Law Firm-they will send out one of their experienced mesothelioma attorneys to learn more about the person's asbestos exposure, to explain the mesothelioma compensation process, and to assess what the person's claim might be worth. This in home visit to discuss compensation with a representative from The Gori Law Firm is no obligation.
"We are certain this is a much, much better option than a free booklet about mesothelioma as the attorneys at The Gori Law Firm are always more than happy to discuss anytime including weekends or holidays at 866-532-2106" https://GoriLaw.com
According to the CDC the states indicated with the highest incidence of mesothelioma include Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota, Louisiana, Washington, and Oregon.
However, based on the calls the Mesothelioma Victims Center receives a person with recently diagnosed mesothelioma could live in any state including New York, Florida, California, Texas, Illinois, Ohio, Iowa, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, Idaho, or Alaska. https://MesotheliomaVictimsCenter.com
High-risk work groups for exposure to asbestos include US Navy Veterans, power plant workers, shipyard workers, oil refinery workers, steel mill workers, manufacturing/factory workers, pulp or paper mill workers, plumbers, electricians, auto mechanics, machinists, miners, construction workers, insulators, railroad worker, roofers, or firemen. As a rule, these types of workers were exposed to asbestos in the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's, or 1980's. US Navy Veterans make up about one-third of all US Citizens who are diagnosed with mesothelioma each year. https://GoriLaw.com

Full text: EL CAJON, Calif., Nov. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Cajon Valley Union School District has been recognized as District of the Year in the annual K-12 Dive Awards .
"We are delighted to be recognized by industry experts as the district of the year in a world where so many are doing great work." said Michelle Hayes, Assistant Superintendent of Personnel Services. "As a team, we focus on being the best place to live, work, play and raise a family by developing happy kids, in healthy relationships, on paths to gainful employment. We are so grateful for the recognition of our staff who arrive each day with passion for their work and love for each student. It is a great testament of the amazing things everyone here at Cajon Valley is doing.  I am so proud of our team and the opportunities we have created for our students, staff, and the community."  
The K-12 Dive editorial team selected its district, superintendent and principal of the year based on reporting from the past year and the suggestions of other education leaders. This year's honorees highlight innovation in overcoming the many obstacles facing schools — and in expanding opportunities for students to succeed. Despite challenges including ongoing pandemic fallout, teacher shortages and natural disasters, you'll find a common thread among all three: a commitment to clearly conveying high expectations, building strong culture and relationships, and expanding students' senses of what's possible.
"This year's winners truly highlight the importance of community and communication," said Roger Riddell, K-12 Dive senior editor. "Whether they set out to improve perceptions and raise achievement, build relationships and address school workforce concerns, or set every student on the path to understanding themselves and what they want from their future careers, this year's winners all share that common thread."
K-12 Dive covers news and analyzes trends specifically for elementary, middle and high school educators, administrators, superintendents, and other leaders and decision makers. It launched the K-12 Dive Awards in 2016 to share the stories and accomplishments of the most impactful achievements, people and school systems in K-12 each calendar year.

Eric Brunner Exonerated Based on Key DNA Evidence Provided by DNA Diagnostics Center (DDC) in Partnership with the Ohio Innocence Project

Full text: FAIRFIELD, Ohio, Nov. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- DNA Diagnostics Center, Inc. ("DDC"), part of the global network of Eurofins companies, announces that Eric Brunner, a Canton, OH man who was convicted of rape and attempted rape of two women in 1996, has been exonerated based on key DNA analysis performed by DDC's Forensics Department in conjunction with the Ohio Innocence Project (OIP). Mr. Brunner served 13 years in prison before he was released on parole in 2009.
After Mr. Brunner's release, the OIP worked to overturn the conviction due to the limitations and stigmatization that Mr. Brunner experienced from the conviction and sexual offender status, including opportunities for employment and housing.
In 2019, DNA testing conducted by DDC Forensics definitively concluded that Mr. Brunner's DNA did not match the perpetrator's DNA collected from the rape kit. Based on this evidence, the Stark County judge overturned the rape conviction. On August 30, 2022, Ohio's Fifth District Court of Appeals also overturned the attempted rape conviction, freeing Mr. Brunner of sexual offender status.
DDC Forensics is proud to have provided the DNA testing in this case, applauds the OIP for its success in freeing Mr. Brunner from both convictions, and hopes this ruling can provide a pathway to healing for Mr. Brunner.
Brian Howe, Brunner's attorney at the OIP, said "DDC Forensics was able to get a clean, unambiguous DNA profile from the rape kit evidence using technological advancements not previously available. Thanks to DDC's outstanding work, Eric Brunner now has physical proof to back up his longstanding innocence claims."
DDC has partnered with Innocence Projects throughout the U.S. on over 100 cases to analyze DNA evidence since the foundation of DDC's Forensics Department in 2003, including fourteen exonerations.

Full text: BOSTON, Nov. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The world is on a quest for solutions to decarbonize its economy. More than 70 countries and over 1,200 companies have set a net-zero target, according to the United Nations. To limit warming to less than 2°C, emissions of hundreds of gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) would need to be prevented and removed from the atmosphere.
Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) is recognized as one of the key technologies to achieve these climate goals, tackling emissions from energy and industrial sectors, as well as removing CO₂ from the atmosphere. However, despite the critical importance of the technology and substantial development to date, CCUS deployment has been slower than anticipated.

Despite the near fourfold growth in the past 20 years, the current deployment of CCUS is still limited. CCUS capacity growth has been around 2.3Mtpa of added capacity since 2010, with annual capture capacity reaching 41Mtpa of CO₂ in 2020. This is 86% short of the ambition the International Energy Agency (IEA) set a decade prior. The current global CO₂ capture capacity is equivalent to 0.1% of overall emissions.
After years of a declining investment pipeline, there has been significant acceleration in the sector for the past two years, with multiple announcements of new integrated CCUS facilities. Most of these are in North America and Europe, but projects are also planned in Australia, China, Korea, the Middle East, and Chile. Still, the industry needs to grow more than 35-fold by 2030 to reach the capture capacity required for net-zero emissions as per the IEA's Net-Zero Emissions (NZE) by 2050 Scenario (IEA, 2021).
The CCUS Landscape has Seen a Vast Change
The first industrial large-scale CCUS project commenced operation about 50 years ago at the Val Verde natural gas processing plant in Texas, US. Instead of being vented, the CO₂ captured was compressed and transported through a pipeline and then injected into the SACROC field for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Natural gas processing plants supplying CO₂ for EOR became the standard of the CCUS industry, with some of the largest integrated CCUS projects in the world being a combination of these two. Notably, the Century Plant in the US and the Santos Basin Pre-Salt project in Brazil, each capable of capturing up to 8.4 and 8.7Mtpa of CO₂, respectively. Europe was the second continent to see CCUS projects appearing, with Norway's Sleipner project for dedicated storage purposes in 1996.
After a plateau during the 2000s, the number of CCUS projects in operation has taken off since 2010, but the CCUS industry saw high-profile project cancellations and government funding programs that failed to deliver. IDTechEx's research indicates that more than 60% of proposed projects have been canceled on average, notably in the power sector. The failure of the Kemper County carbon capture facility in 2017 and the mothballing of the CCS retrofit unit at the Petra Nova plant in Texas in 2020 have brought into question the CCUS industry's ability to deliver large-scale projects that are profitable and low carbon.
Delays have also been commonplace. The CCS component of the Gorgon Facility came online some two years behind schedule, and Lake Charles (US), Teeside Low Carbon (UK), and the Drax facility (UK) have all suffered years of setbacks.
A number of factors contributed to these obstructions, but they were mostly due to economic reasons (fluctuating markets, insufficient financial support), technical issues (flow assurance, solvent degradation, insufficient storage capacity), and lack of public acceptance. Additionally, as the western world has moved away from coal, many large-scale projects of coal power plants that were meant to be fitted with CCS capabilities never came to fruition.
In the last decade, the CCUS industry focus shifted from power towards industries considered 'hard to decarbonize' (for example, the cement and iron and steel industries), the emerging hydrogen economy, as well as new negative emission technologies (NETs).
The Momentum Behind CCUS is Building Up
There has been great momentum behind CCUS in 2022, with projects, new policies, and funding announced. Building up to this year's developments, the UN's Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November 2021 reinvigorated net-zero targets and fostered multi-country partnerships in CCUS. That same month, the US passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, providing a combined US$15 billion to support CCUS and low-carbon hydrogen production.
Nearly 20 additional projects were announced in 2022 alone, which, if developed successfully, will add more than 90Mtpa of new CO₂ capture capacity. However, many of these projects have not yet passed the final investment decision (FID), so their future is still uncertain.
Important advances have also happened in licensing and permitting for geological CO₂ storage throughout 2022. The industry has seen an increase in licensing activity in Norway, Russia, and Australia. As well as the UK launching the first-of-its-kind CO₂ storage licensing round, which consists of 13 areas across the North Sea made up of saline aquifers and depleted oil and gas field storage opportunities.  
With the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, the US is set to substantially increase the support for carbon capture technologies in the coming years. The IRA brings improvements to the 45Q tax credit incentive for carbon sequestration, which has played a crucial role in expanding the adoption of CCUS in the United States since 2008. Sectors that have previously been unable to consider such technologies because it was cost prohibitive can now rethink their decarbonization strategies. The full impact of these credits is yet to be seen. The industry may see a sharp increase in announcements from 2023 onwards in the US as developers rush to meet the 2033 eligibility deadline to commence construction.
CCUS as a Transitional Technology
In many industries, CCUS is considered a transitional option to get carbon-intensive assets to their end of life or to serve as a stepping stone to more sustainable technologies that are still under development. Some of these key CCUS applications include:
- Hard-to-abate sectors with inherent process emissions such as cement, iron & steel, and chemicals. Renewable fuel switching and efficiency improvements will not be enough to decarbonize these industries.
- Blue hydrogen production, where CCUS safely disposes of the CO₂ produced during traditional steam methane reforming. Blue hydrogen is set to play a key role in creating new markets for hydrogen as a clean energy carrier, acting as a bridge for green H 2 once electrolyzer capacity catches up.
- E-fuels production, where CO₂ from emissions can be converted into hydrocarbons using renewable energy. E-fuels can take care of legacy internal combustion engine vehicles while electric vehicles gain market share and of long-haul transportation (planes, ships, trucks), while battery technology advances and becomes lighter.

Ultimately, CCUS can create a demand for captured CO₂ until carbon prices are sufficiently high. CO₂-EOR has been an on-ramp for CCS and, more recently, for DAC and may continue to do so alongside other emerging uses of CO₂ as a feedstock for chemicals, fuels, and building materials. For further information on CO₂ utilization, please refer to IDTechEx's report "Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) Utilization 2022-2042: Technologies, Market Forecasts, and Players".
CCUS as an Enduring Technology: Carbon Dioxide Removal
While point-source carbon capture may play a crucial role in the energy transition, Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) may be needed beyond that. CDR is present in every credible, long-term climate scenario to take and maintain the world at the net-zero level of emissions. Given its potential, there has never been more focus on removing CO₂ from the atmosphere using NETs such as Direct Air Capture (DAC). Venture capitalists have poured more than US$1 billion into the nascent DAC industry in 2022, with the biggest slice of the pie going to Climeworks' latest funding round worth US$650 million – more than the total amount invested in DAC in the past five years.
DAC players are racing to drive the cost down to US$100 per net tonne of CO₂ removed and to reach the gigatonne scale of annual removals. Both milestones are complementary, as scale and cost will likely evolve in tandem. Standardizing a robust methodology for monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) of carbon removals will be essential to achieve those goals.
It is an exciting time to be in the carbon removal space as the sector abounds with investments, dynamism, and hope. Startups, early buyers, research institutes, and policymakers are collaborating to advance the technologies and the conditions for market consolidation. For more information on the CDR market, see the new IDTechEx report, "Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) Markets 2023-2040: Technologies, Players, and Forecasts".
Will CCUS Finally Take-off?
The fundamental role of CCUS is to provide an infrastructure capable of securely and permanently isolating millions of tonnes of CO₂ away from the atmosphere. CCUS will be critical in enabling the level of decarbonization required to achieve the net-zero emissions targets stipulated in the UN Paris Agreement. But for this, it needs to scale.
Despite the fair level of maturity, carbon capture technologies remain largely costly, energy-intensive, and underdeveloped. Questions remain around the willingness of governments to ensure a proper price for carbon through cap-and-trade or other incentive schemes and of investors to financially support large-scale CCUS projects. Meeting CCUS' ambition to slow down climate change requires a step-change in policy and coordinated worldwide action that is shaping up, but it is yet to be fully realized.

Full text: HELSINKI, Nov. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --  Helsinki has become a hotspot for new material development companies such as Spinnova, Infinited Fibre and Metsä Spring - but also for socially and culturally responsible new fashion brands. Helsinki Partners, a  city marketing, investment and talent attraction company owned by the City of Helsinki, works closely with the designers and new companies to create an  active testbed for new solutions and innovations in the fields of fashion and textile in Helsinki. 
"For most of the new brands working in the field of fashion in Helsinki, the key driver is the city's values, such as equality and transparency," Annamari Vänskä from the Aalto University explains. "Our history of egalitarian design helps both the designers and consumers to make sustainable choices. Social and environmental responsibility drives especially Generation Z in Helsinki." 
In 2022, 78% of 18-25 years old Finns named integrity, forgiveness, helping others, and taking responsibility as their most important values. 48% are also willing to pay more for products that are responsible.* The city, for example, has partnered with the local fashion event, Fashion in Helsinki, to gain global visibility and network with young designers and new responsible brands. 
The Sisterhood brought Helsinki´s diversity to international catwalks 
The 2020´s has seen an invasion of Finnish models to international catwalks. Most of these new models have come from a new boutique model agency from Helsinki, The Sisterhood. Jasmin Islamovic (b.1983) opened The Sisterhood only about a year ago but already their clients include major international fashion brands such as Balenciaga, Prada, Gucci and Celine. For Islamovic, it was important to make an agency, that was rooted in their own values. The Sisterhood does not, for example, differentiate between male or female models many of whom identify as LGBTQ+. "I do casting according my own view of the world, what I believe in and what I find interesting. It is my vision of beauty," Islamovic says.  
Islamovic came to Finland in 1996 from the former Yugoslavia area as a refugee. They say that their background has helped them to understand their models who have had similar experiences of feeling different and struggling to find their identity. The Sisterhood´s models don't usually have any previous modelling experience as Islamovic casts them directly from Helsinki´s streets, trams, grocery stores or other everyday places. 
"There is something special about Helsinki, it is a combination of melancholy and a sense of humor that you don't get anywhere else. The background of The Sisterhood's models may vary, but all of them have been living their youth in Helsinki and the city´s vibe affects their style, values, and general way of being. Somehow you can see that these people are not from Paris or Stockholm," Islamovic states.

Latimer redefines the idea of masculinity 
Latimmier is a high-end ready-to-wear label based in Helsinki and, at the same time, an experimental project redefining the concept of masculinity. It is brought to life through the fashion of designer Ervin Latimer (b.1988). The brand aims to redefine the idea of masculinity and Latimmier invites everyone to examine the masculinity within themselves. The brand received a lot of attention over the past year through events such as Pitti Uomo and Copenhagen Fashion Week. In addition to his work as a designer, Latimer has written and lectured on the intersections of queer-culture, anti-racism, masculinity, and fashion. 
"The fashion scene in Helsinki has gotten really interesting. Many Nordic labels work with issues related to gender in one way or another, whether it's a unisex, fluid or another otherwise unconventional approach. It has become a part of Helsinki's fashion scene very naturally. Especially the younger designers have been able to find their own voices around this topic," Latimer states listing designers and brands such as Maria Korkeila, By Hinders, and Rolf Ekroth. 
"I'm especially happy with the informality of dressing in Helsinki. We don't tend to have, for example, strict business dress codes, and you see amazing, very personal styles in the streets, offices, and cafes."

Filled with Fluff Stuff – a new material company provides a natural alternative for unsustainable textile fillings 
Fluff Stuff is a Helsinki based new material innovation company developing climate-positive textile fillings and products. Fluff Stuff replaces unsustainable textile fillings with a natural alternative, such as cattail, and fosters sustainable farming practices. "Cattail was a common filling material in Finland historically, but was then forgotten." co-founder, strategist Tea Auramo tells. "Cattail is completely biodegradable, vegan, non-toxic and works really well as filling material. The Finnish government decided in 2020 to halve the use of peat within a decade as part of its climate strategy, and since then there has been a need to find alternative use for the peat production areas. Cattail grows in these areas naturally and cleans water and soil."  
Auramo works with a team of researchers, designers, engineers and other professionals. She finds Helsinki an excellent place for startups to grow. "When you work with innovations, finding a multidisciplinary team is crucial. The Helsinki area has top universities that combine business, design, fashion, and technology really well. It has become a desirable place for top researchers and has a growing international network of different experts, good living conditions help this as well. Because of both the social and physical structure of Helsinki, networking and collaborating is easy here." 
In the future, Fluff Stuff aims to have its own factory to process cattail on top of the locally sourced raw filling material, the plan is to offer selected textile and fashion products. "For a company that works with innovations, technology and fashion, Helsinki is a very good place to start," Auramo says

TAIPEI, Nov. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- ProLogium Technology, a leader in solid-state battery technology, announced the appointment of Dr. Hsu Wei-Fu to the position of Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Tasked with building an international legal team and global strategy for patent portfolio and IP protection, Hsu Wei-Fu reports directly to Vincent Yang, founder and CEO of ProLogium Technology, effective October 2022.
As the global community strives to achieve the 2050 net zero goal, governments are doubling down efforts to expedite energy transition in the transport sector, a trend that further highlights the strategic importance of lithium battery - the heart of an electric vehicle. As battery is recognized as a key enabling technology, countries and industry leaders are ramping up R&D efforts and production capacities for lithium-ion batteries. The battery industry is expected to see exponential growth in the long term, driven by strong demand and tailwinds, with a CAGR to reach several times that of the semiconductor industry within a decade.
ProLogium Technology's in-house developed solid-state battery (SSB) technology offers a solution to challenges facing conventional lithium-ion batteries in terms of safety and performance. The battery maker has secured strategic partnerships and investments from international premium EV brands. As part of the company's strategy to establish bases close to customers and produce locally, ProLogium announced its global capacity expansion plans earlier this year and launched an overseas site selection project with a planned total capacity of 120 GWh. When completed, this project will mark a key milestone for the industrialization of solid-state battery.
Dr. Hsu Wei-Fu will lead the efforts to establish a global legal team and ensure trade secret protection as ProLogium seeks to deepen its collaboration with customers worldwide and expand its production capacities overseas for next-generation batteries. He will play an instrumental role in the company's endeavors to maintain its leading position in SSB technology.
Prior to joining ProLogium, Dr. Hsu was the co-founder, Senior Vice President, and General Counsel of MEMS semiconductor tech firm xMEMS Labs in the U.S. and Vice President and General Counsel of semiconductor giant MediaTek in Taiwan. His area of expertise is intellectual property management for high tech industry.
As the founding general counsel of MediaTek, Dr. Hsu established its legal and IP teams, complete with internal procedures and systems, when the company had only around 100 global patent count. Under his leadership, the MediaTek legal team went head to head against global industry giants at the negotiation table and successfully resolved major patent disputes. With his extensive experience and knowledge, he formulated global IP strategy that helped MediaTek achieve great success and sustain continued growth despite tremendous IP barriers and challenges while protecting the company's technology innovation.
Dr. Hsu is also a trailblazer who spearheaded the legislative reform for trade secret protection in Taiwan. In 2012, he worked with Taiwan Intellectual Property Office and legislators to push for an overhaul of the Trade Secrets Act. The landmark legislation made Taiwan a world leader in intellectual property protection and has since provided formidable support and impetus for the growth of the island's high tech industry. In 2014, Dr. Hsu was included in Legal 500's ranking of top 100 most influential and innovative corporate legal advisors in the Asia Pacific region.
"ProLogium is at a critical juncture for its transformation, like a kung fu master who has been training in solitude in the mountains for years and is now ready to embark on a new journey and shine on the world stage. In the near term, ProLogium targets global car OEMs as potential clients, but in the future, our batteries can be integrated in all kinds of applications. That's why we need to transform into a world-class company. I'm honored to join ProLogium on this glorious journey, and I look forward to building an international legal team to help ProLogium become a global leading company," Dr. Hsu remarks.
ProLogium founder and CEO Vincent Yang stated that "Dr. Hsu is a legendary figure in Taiwan's intellectual property legal profession. He is a valuable addition to ProLogium. As the world shifts towards sustainability and net-zero, ProLogium is well-positioned to become a world-leading next-gen battery maker. Our global expansion plans have received significant support from international customers and the public sector, and a robust legal team and well-rounded patent portfolio strategy are crucial in our efforts to become a global leading SSB manufacturer. We expect to rely on Dr. Hsu's IP and legal expertise to safeguard our intellectual property – the intangible, yet invaluable assets that will help maintain our leading edge in technology development and industrialization for next-generation batteries."

SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- J INTS BIO announced that the preclinical assessment of JIN-001 or MPT0B640, a novel, orally administered 2 nd generation HSP90 (heat shock protein 90) inhibitor, was presented during the 2022 edition of the Society for Neuro-Oncology Conference, held in Tampa, Florida from 17th to 20th November.
The company revealed that it started the joint development of JIN-001 with MD Anderson Cancer Center in March last year, looking at the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme both as a monotherapy and in combination with temozolomide.
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant type of brain cancer with a poor prognosis and a median patient survival of approximately 18 months. It is difficult to treat, and cure is usually not possible. HSP90 is overexpressed in brain cancer and supports cancer cell survival and resistance. HSP90 inhibition therefore can impact pathways essential for cancer cell survival and overcome tumor heterogeneity.
Preclinical data showed that JIN-001 is potent against a wide spectrum of diverse glioma cell lines in a dose and time dependent manner, by downregulating client proteins essential for glioma cell survival. In addition, JIN-001 is highly penetrant of the normal Blood Brain Barrier with greater drug exposure in the brain versus the plasma, and this has resulted in a significant survival benefit in intracranial mouse model.
J INTS BIO is confident that JIN-001 will benefit patients with GBM and in collaboration with MD Anderson, to start human trials in GBM patients in 2023.

Full text: Recent release "The Cemetery" from Page Publishing author Steven Huffine is an engrossing novel that introduces the Hardings, who are extremely happy with their recent move to Granite. The quiet country farmhouse is everything they had hoped for, but it holds a dark secret.
CLARKRIDGE, Ark., Nov. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Steven Huffine, a lifelong resident of Arkansas, has completed his new book "The Cemetery": a gripping and potent novel that follows the Hardings as they adjust to their new home, finding new secrets around every corner.
As Halloween approaches, local ghost stories begin manifesting themselves into real-life nightmares. An abandoned cemetery has a long history of eerie sightings and strange occurrences. The family is forced to confront evil face-to-face.
Growing up, author Steven Huffine was introduced to horror classics, which fueled his interest in the strange and unknown. As a teenager, he and his friends traveled country backroads in search of the elusive Bigfoot and investigated local urban legends. As an adult, Steven earned his paramedic certification and has proudly served his state for over thirty years. He currently works as a flight paramedic. In his downtime, he enjoys drawing, spending time with his wife and children, boating on local lakes, and restoring vintage emergency lights.
Author Steven Huffine writes, "The sun slowly drifted lower and lower in the western sky as Mark made his way across the open pasture after school. Shadows grew longer, and a strange feeling of dread began to set in. The day had been long as he made his way through each class. He never really liked school, as most kids don't, but he never hated it either. Since moving from Portersville to Granite, Mark Harding was just trying to fit in and get some semblance of a normal life. Although he and his parents had only been in town for two months, things were already looking up. He had made good friends with two boys at school and had caught the interest of one of the varsity cheerleaders. Mark had a good life back in Portersville."
Published by Page Publishing, Steven Huffine's suspenseful tale invites readers to discover whether the Hardings will die in the grips of a demonic supernatural power or find a way to destroy it.
Readers who wish to experience this thrilling work can purchase "The Cemetery" at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes Store, Amazon, Google Play, or Barnes and Noble.

SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- J INTS BIO announced that the preclinical assessment of JIN-001 or MPT0B640, a novel, orally administered 2 nd generation HSP90 (heat shock protein 90) inhibitor, was presented during the 2022 edition of the Society for Neuro-Oncology Conference, held in Tampa, Florida from 17th to 20th November.
The company revealed that it started the joint development of JIN-001 with MD Anderson Cancer Center in March last year, looking at the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme both as a monotherapy and in combination with temozolomide.
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant type of brain cancer with a poor prognosis and a median patient survival of approximately 18 months. It is difficult to treat, and cure is usually not possible. HSP90 is overexpressed in brain cancer and supports cancer cell survival and resistance. HSP90 inhibition therefore can impact pathways essential for cancer cell survival and overcome tumor heterogeneity.
Preclinical data showed that JIN-001 is potent against a wide spectrum of diverse glioma cell lines in a dose and time dependent manner, by downregulating client proteins essential for glioma cell survival. In addition, JIN-001 is highly penetrant of the normal Blood Brain Barrier with greater drug exposure in the brain versus the plasma, and this has resulted in a significant survival benefit in intracranial mouse model.
J INTS BIO is confident that JIN-001 will benefit patients with GBM and in collaboration with MD Anderson, to start human trials in GBM patients in 2023.
About JIN-001
JIN-001 is a novel, orally administered 2 nd generation HSP90 inhibitor developed to overcome tumor heterogeneity and cancer cell survival. It is expected to be a game changer in obviating tumor resistance and survival, and thereby improving the treatment outcomes for patients.

MANILA, Philippines, Nov. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Philippines' largest fully integrated telco PLDT will continue to expand its international cable network as the initial phase of cable construction of the Asia Direct Cable (ADC) begins.
The construction of the 9,400-kilometer subsea cable will commence in the Philippines and target completion of all landing links is end of 2023. When completed, ADC will link seven international cable landing points across East and Southeast Asia from Batangas, Philippines to Tuas, Singapore; Chung Hom Kok, Hong Kong; Maruyama, Japan; Quy Nhon, Vietnam; Sri Racha, Thailand; and Shantou, Mainland China.
"Along with PLDT's existing international submarine cable systems, the Asia Direct Cable will boost and diversify the Philippines' connectivity within the Asian region," said PLDT President & CEO, Al S. Panlilio. 
"ADC will strengthen not only PLDT's global network, but will also further advance the country's digitalization and growing digital economy," adds Panlilio.
ADC will feature a minimum of 200G DWDM system per wavelength design, which will significantly expand PLDT's network bandwidth going in and out of the country. Once fully equipped, this will provide PLDT an additional international network capacity of at least 36Tbps for faster delivery of hyperscale data across East and Southeast Asia.
"The Asia Direct Cable will strongly bolster PLDT's mission to make the Philippines the next hyperscaler destination in Asia-Pacific. This investment solidifies our commitment to enrich and synergize the country's Hyperscale Ecosystem of connected digital infrastructures, such as data centers, subsea cables, domestic fiber network, 5G, cloud, and IOT," said PLDT SVP & Head of Enterprise Business Group, Jojo G. Gendrano.
ADC and the recently energized Jupiter cable system will drive global data straight to and from VITRO Sta. Rosa and the rest of PLDT's data center facilities across the country, strengthening the Philippines' advantage as a strategic digital hub in the region.
ADC is a global consortium comprised of leading technology companies, including PLDT, China Telecom, China Unicom, National Telecom, Singtel, SoftBank Corp., Tata Communications and Viettel Group.

SAN DIEGO, Nov. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Sempra (NYSE: SRE) (BMV: SRE) today announced that its subsidiary, Sempra Infrastructure, and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) have executed a 20-year Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) for 5 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Phase 1 of the proposed Port Arthur LNG project under development in Jefferson County, Texas.
The parties have also entered into an equity sale and purchase agreement whereby ConocoPhillips will acquire 30% of the equity in Phase 1 of Port Arthur LNG, and a natural gas supply management agreement whereby ConocoPhillips will manage the feedgas supply requirements for Phase 1 of the proposed liquefaction facility.
"At Sempra, we certainly believe that great projects are the result of great partnerships," said Jeffrey W. Martin, chairman and chief executive officer of Sempra. "That is why we are excited to announce a broad strategic relationship with ConocoPhillips, which has a growing global footprint across the LNG value chain. Together, we have a shared view of the role this facility can play in supporting global economies with energy supplies that advance both energy security and environmental goals."
"We are excited to partner with Sempra, and our participation in the Port Arthur LNG project will further enhance our portfolio as we continue to respond to global demand for reliable supply of natural gas," said Ryan Lance, chairman and chief executive officer of ConocoPhillips. "Sempra has a demonstrated track record of success and shares our commitment to a lower-carbon future."
Sempra Infrastructure recently announced it is expecting to make a final investment decision (FID) for Phase 1 of the liquefaction project in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, the company announced last month that it had finalized an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract with Bechtel Energy for Phase 1. Under the terms of the EPC contract, Bechtel will perform the detailed engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, startup, performance testing and operator training activities.
The Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project is permitted and expected to include two natural gas liquefaction trains and LNG storage tanks, and associated facilities capable of producing, under optimal conditions, up to approximately 13.5 Mtpa of LNG. A similarly sized Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 project is also competitively positioned and under active marketing and development.
Development of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Port Arthur LNG project is contingent on completing the required commercial agreements, securing all necessary permits, obtaining financing and reaching an affirmative final investment decision, among other factors.

Full text: -  This historic approval provides a new treatment option that reduces the rate of annual bleeds, reduces or eliminates the need for prophylactic therapy and generates elevated and sustained factor IX levels for years after a one-time infusion
-  With the approval of HEMGENIX, CSL now offers an even more comprehensive portfolio of treatments for people living with hemophilia B, ushering in a new era of treatment options
KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa., Nov. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Global biotechnology leader CSL (ASX: CSL) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved HEMGENIX ® (etranacogene dezaparvovec-drlb), the first and only one-time gene therapy for appropriate adults with hemophilia B. HEMGENIX is approved for the treatment of adults with hemophilia B who currently use factor IX prophylaxis therapy, or have current or historical life-threatening hemorrhage or have repeated, serious spontaneous bleeding episodes. In the ongoing clinical trial, HEMGENIX reduced the rate of annual bleeds and 94 percent of patients discontinued factor IX prophylaxis and remained prophylaxis-free.

"As part of our promise to patients, CSL is committed to delivering innovative and groundbreaking solutions to address unmet medical needs, and we are proud to introduce the next wave of breakthrough medicines for people living with hemophilia B," said Paul Perreault, CSL's Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director. "We recognize and thank all trial participants, scientists and investigators—without whom this important achievement would not have been possible—and look forward to seeing the positive impact of HEMGENIX on the hemophilia B community."
Hemophilia B is a rare, lifelong bleeding disorder caused by a single gene defect, resulting in insufficient production of factor IX, a protein primarily produced by the liver that helps blood clots form. Treatments for moderate to severe hemophilia B include prophylactic infusions of factor IX replacement therapy to temporarily replace or supplement low levels of blood-clotting factor and, while these therapies are effective, those with hemophilia B must adhere to strict, lifelong infusion schedules. They may also still experience spontaneous bleeding episodes as well as limited mobility, joint damage or severe pain as a result of the disease. For appropriate patients, HEMGENIX allows people living with hemophilia B to produce their own factor IX, which can lower the risk of bleeding.
"We are thrilled to witness this milestone in hemophilia B treatment," shared Kim Phelan, Chief Operating Officer of The Coalition for Hemophilia B. "Over the years we have seen a variety of advancements for the hemophilia community, but gene therapy is the first treatment option to offer those living with hemophilia B--and caregivers--the possibility of freedom from the need for regular, ongoing infusions."
The FDA approval is supported by results from the ongoing HOPE-B trial, the largest gene therapy trial in hemophilia B to date. Results from the study demonstrated that HEMGENIX allowed patients to produce mean factor IX activity of 39 percent at six months and 36.7 percent at 24 months post infusion. Seven to 18 months post-infusion, the mean adjusted annualized bleeding rate (ABR) for all bleeds was reduced by 54 percent compared to the six-month lead-in period on factor IX prophylactic replacement therapy (4.1 to 1.9). In addition, 94 percent (51 out of 54) of patients treated with HEMGENIX discontinued use of prophylaxis and remained free of previous continuous routine prophylaxis therapy. The most common side effects (incidence ≥5%) were liver enzyme elevations, headache, elevated levels of a certain blood enzyme, flu-like symptoms, infusion-related reactions, fatigue, nausea and feeling unwell.  
"HEMGENIX is unique in its approach to increasing mean factor IX activity and hemostatic protection in those with hemophilia B, and today's approval could fundamentally transform the treatment paradigm for this life-long condition," said Dr. Steven Pipe, Professor and the Laurence A. Boxer Research Professor of Pediatrics and Professor of Pathology at the University of Michigan and a lead investigator in the HOPE-B study. "As a clinician, I look forward to being able to provide a new treatment option that may help patients treated with HEMGENIX become free from the regular infusion schedule that many people living with hemophilia B rely on to protect them from the debilitating effects of the condition."
The multi-year clinical development program for HEMGENIX was led by uniQure (Nasdaq: QURE), and sponsorship of the clinical trials transitioned to CSL after it acquired global rights to commercialize the treatment.
"Today's approval of the world's first gene therapy for hemophilia B is an historic achievement based on more than a decade of research and clinical development," said Matt Kapusta, Chief Executive Officer, uniQure. "We have always believed that gene therapy had the potential to provide transformative benefits to people living with hemophilia B and are excited that the hemophilia community will have a new, safe and effective treatment option available to them."
CSL Behring, a CSL business, will make HEMGENIX available for eligible people with hemophilia B as soon as possible.
"CSL is proud to have been at the forefront of providing life-changing medicines for rare diseases for over a century. Today's historic approval builds on our promise to put patients first in all that we do to discover, develop and deliver biotherapeutics and vaccines that meet their needs," said Bill Mezzanotte, Head of Research & Development and Chief Medical Officer of CSL. "With HEMGENIX, we now offer a comprehensive portfolio of innovative medicines for hemophilia B, giving people living with the condition more choice in treatments and better and more durable control over their disease."
HEMGENIX is still currently under assessment by other regulatory agencies.
About Hemophilia B  
Hemophilia B is a life-threatening rare disease. People with the condition are particularly vulnerable to bleeds in their joints, muscles, and internal organs, leading to pain, swelling, and joint damage. Current treatments for moderate to severe hemophilia B include life-long prophylactic infusions of factor IX to temporarily replace or supplement low levels of the blood-clotting factor.  
About HEMGENIX  
HEMGENIX is a gene therapy that reduces the rate of abnormal bleeding in eligible people with hemophilia B by enabling the body to continuously produce factor IX, the deficient protein in hemophilia B. It uses AAV5, a non-infectious viral vector, called an adeno-associated virus (AAV). The AAV5 vector carries the Padua gene variant of Factor IX (FIX-Padua) to the target cells in the liver, generating factor IX proteins that are 5x-8x more active than normal. These genetic instructions remain in the target cells, but generally do not become a part of a person's own DNA. Once delivered, the new genetic instructions allow the cellular machinery to produce stable levels of factor IX.
About the Pivotal HOPE-B Trial
The pivotal Phase III HOPE-B trial is an ongoing, multinational, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HEMGENIX. Fifty-four adult hemophilia B patients classified as having moderately severe to severe hemophilia B and requiring prophylactic factor IX replacement therapy were enrolled in a prospective, six-month or longer observational period during which time they continued to use their current standard of care therapy to establish a baseline Annual Bleeding Rate (ABR). After the six-month lead-in period, patients received a single intravenous administration of HEMGENIX at the 2x10^13 gc/kg dose. Patients were not excluded from the trial based on pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to AAV5.
A total of 54 patients received a single dose of HEMGENIX in the pivotal trial, with 53 patients completing at least 18 months of follow-up. The primary endpoint in the pivotal HOPE-B study was ABR 52 weeks after achievement of stable factor IX expression (months 7 to 18) compared with the six-month lead-in period. For this endpoint, ABR was measured from month seven to month 18 after infusion, ensuring the observation period represented a steady-state factor IX transgene expression. Secondary endpoints included assessment of factor IX activity.
No serious adverse reactions were reported. One death resulting from urosepsis and cardiogenic shock in a 77-year-old patient at 65 weeks following dosing was considered unrelated to treatment by investigators and the company sponsor. A serious adverse event of hepatocellular carcinoma was determined to be unrelated to treatment with HEMGENIX by independent molecular tumor characterization and vector integration analysis. No inhibitors to factor IX were reported. 
Important Safety Information   (ISI)
What is HEMGENIX?
HEMGENIX ® , etranacogene dezaparvovec-drlb, is a one-time gene therapy for the treatment of adults with hemophilia B who:
- Currently use Factor IX prophylaxis therapy, or
- Have current or historical life-threatening bleeding, or
- Have repeated, serious spontaneous bleeding episodes.

HEMGENIX is administered as a single intravenous infusion and can be administered only once.
What medical testing can I expect to be given before and after administration of HEMGENIX?
To determine your eligibility to receive HEMGENIX, you will be tested for Factor IX inhibitors. If this test result is positive, a retest will be performed 2 weeks later. If both tests are positive for Factor IX inhibitors, your doctor will not administer HEMGENIX to you. If, after administration of HEMGENIX, increased Factor IX activity is not achieved, or bleeding is not controlled, a post-dose test for Factor IX inhibitors will be performed.
HEMGENIX may lead to elevations of liver enzymes in the blood; therefore, ultrasound and other testing will be performed to check on liver health before HEMGENIX can be administered. Following administration of HEMGENIX, your doctor will monitor your liver enzyme levels weekly for at least 3 months. If you have preexisting risk factors for liver cancer, regular liver health testing will continue for 5 years post-administration. Treatment for elevated liver enzymes could include corticosteroids.
What were the most common side effects of HEMGENIX in clinical trials?
In clinical trials for HEMGENIX, the most common side effects reported in more than 5% of patients were liver enzyme elevations, headache, elevated levels of a certain blood enzyme, flu-like symptoms, infusion-related reactions, fatigue, nausea, and feeling unwell. These are not the only side effects possible. Tell your healthcare provider about any side effect you may experience.
What should I watch for during infusion with HEMGENIX?
Your doctor will monitor you for infusion-related reactions during administration of HEMGENIX, as well as for at least 3 hours after the infusion is complete. Symptoms may include chest tightness, headaches, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, flu-like symptoms, shivering, flushing, rash, and elevated blood pressure. If an infusion-related reaction occurs, the doctor may slow or stop the HEMGENIX infusion, resuming at a lower infusion rate once symptoms resolve.
What should I avoid after receiving HEMGENIX?
Small amounts of HEMGENIX may be present in your blood, semen, and other excreted/secreted materials, and it is not known how long this continues. You should not donate blood, organs, tissues, or cells for transplantation after receiving HEMGENIX.
Please see full prescribing information  for HEMGENIX.
You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch, or call 1-800-FDA-1088.
You can also report side effects to CSL Behring's Pharmacovigilance Department at 1-866-915-6958.

Traditional IT capabilities, structures, and culture must change to leverage the value of the cloud, optimize spend, and manage risk.
TORONTO, Nov. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - As the cloud becomes much more widespread, its adoption has created both new opportunities and challenges. To help technology leaders build a framework to define cloud work and successfully align it to the right areas, global IT research and advisory firm Info-Tech Research Group has published a new blueprint, Design Your Cloud Operations .
Based on research findings, the firm anticipates that traditional IT capabilities, activities, organizational structures, and culture will need to adjust to leverage the full value of cloud services, optimize spending, and manage risks.
Currently, different stakeholders across previously separate teams rely on one another more than ever, but rules of engagement do not yet exist, which can lead to a lack of direction, employee frustration, missed work, inefficiency, and unacceptable risk.
"Just because an employee is in the cloud doesn't mean everyone is on the same page about how cloud operations work – or should work,"   says Andrew Sharp , research director at Info-Tech Research Group.   "Organizations have an opportunity to implement new ways of working. But if people can't see the bigger picture – the organizing framework of your cloud operations – it will be harder to get buy-in to realize value from your cloud services."
Research within the new blueprint further highlights that many organizations have bought their way into a software as a service (SaaS) portfolio. As these key applications leave their networks, infrastructure and operations leaders still have accountability for the apps but have little visibility and control over them. As well, not every organization is, or will ever be, cloud-only, so it's expected that operations will continue to be both on-premises and in-cloud for the foreseeable future.
With traditional infrastructure siloes shifting to accommodate a hybrid approach for cloud operations, Info-Tech recommends it is time to consider a step-by-step approach to assess cloud maturity, understand relevant ways of working, and create a meaningful design of cloud operations to align team members and stakeholders. The blueprint breaks down this recommended methodology into four phases:
- Understand Risks, Goals, and Maturity:  Ensure alignment with the risks and drivers of the business and understand the organization's strengths and gaps for a cloud operations world.
- Weigh the Workstreams: Understand the balance of different types of deliveries and the work that must be done to deliver business value.
- Apply the Cloud Pillars and Identify Tasks: Reduce risk by reinforcing the key operational pillars of cloud operations to the workstream.
- Organize Around Business Value:  Identify work areas and decide which area is responsible for what tasks and how work areas should interact to best facilitate desired business outcomes.
Cloud is a different way of consuming IT resources and applications, requiring a different operational approach than traditional IT. In most cases, cloud operations involve less direct execution and more service validation and monitoring. Organizations should define their target cloud operations state first, then plan how to get there. Reconstructing on-prem operations in the cloud first will build an operations model that is the worst of both worlds.

BRONX, N.Y., Nov. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Ulrich Steidl, M.D., Ph.D., an internationally recognized leader in cancer and stem cell biology, has been named the chair of the department of cell biology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Dr. Steidl assumes his new position as Arthur Skoultchi, Ph.D., who has led the department with distinction for 24 years, steps down from departmental leadership. Dr. Steidl is currently professor of cell biology, of oncology, and of medicine; interim director of the Ruth L. and David S. Gottesman Institute for Stem Cell Research and Regenerative Medicine; and the Edward P. Evans Endowed Professor for Myelodysplastic Syndromes at Einstein; and deputy director of Montefiore Einstein Cancer Center (MECC) and co-director of MECC's Blood Cancer Institute.
"Uli's unwavering dedication to scientific excellence, proven leadership abilities, and generosity and success as a mentor and colleague make him the ideal choice to take the helm of our cell biology department," said Gordon F. Tomaselli, M.D., the Marilyn and Stanley M. Katz Dean at Einstein and executive vice president and chief academic officer at Montefiore Medicine. "Given his 14 exceptional years at Einstein, it is a true pleasure to congratulate him on his well-deserved new role."  
Investigations led by Dr. Steidl have made key contributions to the understanding of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), two related blood diseases that he helped characterize as being driven by diverse pools of pre-cancer and cancer stem cells. This work has led to the discovery, study, and therapeutic targeting of such disease-driving stem cells in blood cancers, resulting in pioneering scientific progress as well as innovative clinical trials. His significant contributions in the field were recognized by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) when he received its Outstanding Investigator Award in 2021.
"I am honored to be selected as chair of cell biology at Einstein, and eager to help guide and support the exceptional research conducted by our outstanding faculty members, postdoctoral fellows, students, and laboratory staff," said Dr. Steidl. "It will be a tall order to follow in Art's footsteps, whose unstinting support and steadfast leadership as chair for over two decades has set a high bar. I look forward to continuing the success of the department and enhancing its resources and collaborations within and across departments and centers to drive discovery in human biology with the ultimate goal of improving human health."
Dr. Steidl joined Einstein's faculty in 2008, and in 2013, he was promoted to associate professor and named the associate chair for translational research in the department of medicine (oncology) and the scientific director for that department's division of hemato-oncology. In 2014, he became program co-leader for the Stem Cells, Differentiation, and Cancer Program at the NCI-designated Montefiore Einstein Cancer Center. He became a full professor with tenure in 2017.
Dr. Steidl has received numerous awards at Einstein. His translational research accomplishments were recognized at Einstein's commencement ceremony in 2020 when he received the Saul R. Korey Award in Translation Science and Medicine. On multiple occasions—in 2013, 2017, 2019, and 2020—he received Einstein's Julius Marmur Mentorship Award for Outstanding Mentoring in Graduate Research.
Dr. Steidl also has previously received the Scholar Achievement Award of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and the National Institute of Health's (NIH) Howard Temin Award. He is currently president of the International Society for Experimental Hematology (ISEH), and a member of numerous organizations, including the American Society for Clinical Investigation, American Association for Cancer Research, and American Society of Hematology.
Prior to joining Einstein as an assistant professor, Dr. Steidl received his M.D./Ph.D. degree from the University of Heidelberg Medical School and the German Cancer Research Center, both in Heidelberg, Germany, and trained at Heinrich Heine University Medical Center in Dusseldorf, Germany, as well as at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.

E-learning Market 2022-2026: Key Driver One of the key factors driving growth in the market is the learning process enhancements in the academic sector. The evolution of education technologies began with schools and colleges converting traditional classrooms to digital classrooms by investing in fundamental hardware and software solutions. Technology is transforming K-12 and higher education by empowering teachers as they can reject education technologies that divert student attention. The adoption of content digitization led to an increase in demand for digital education publications.

In-house content developers create a few courses with instructors, add plenty of images and videos, and modify them according to learner engagement and feedback. The increase in the development of in-house content is expected to affect the global eLearning market adversely.

Full text: MILWAUKEE, Nov. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Ademi LLP is investigating AgroFresh (Nasdaq: AGFS) for possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law in its transaction with Paine Schwartz. 
Click here to learn how to join the action https://www.ademilaw.com/case/agrofresh-solutions-inc or call Guri Ademi toll-free at 866-264-3995.  There is no cost or obligation to you.
Ademi LLP alleges AgroFresh's financial outlook and prospects are excellent and yet AgroFresh shareholders are expected to collectively own only $3.00 per share in cash. The transaction agreement unreasonably limits competing bids for AgroFresh by imposing a significant penalty if AgroFresh accepts a superior bid. AgroFresh insiders will receive substantial benefits as part of change of control arrangements.
We are investigating the conduct of AgroFresh's board of directors, and whether they are (i) fulfilling their fiduciary duties to all shareholders, and (ii) obtaining a fair and reasonable price for AgroFresh.
If you own AgroFresh common stock and wish to obtain additional information, please contact Guri Ademi either at gademi@ademilaw.com or toll-free: 866-264-3995, or https://www.ademilaw.com/case/agrofresh-solutions-inc.

Full text: MILWAUKEE, Nov. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Ademi LLP is investigating Graybug (Nasdaq: GRAY) for possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law in its transaction with CalciMedica. 
Click here to learn how to join the action https://www.ademilaw.com/case/graybug-vision-inc or call Guri Ademi toll-free at 866-264-3995.  There is no cost or obligation to you.
Ademi LLP alleges Graybug's financial outlook and prospects are excellent and yet Graybug equity holders are expected to collectively own only approximately 29% of the combined company, and pre-merger CalciMedica equity holders are expected to collectively own approximately 71% of the combined company, in each case, on a fully diluted basis using the treasury stock method. The percentage of the combined company that Graybug's equity holders will own as of the close of the transaction is subject to certain adjustments as described in the merger agreement, including an adjustment based on the amount of Graybug's net cash at closing. The transaction agreement unreasonably limits competing bids for Graybug by imposing a significant penalty if Graybug accepts a superior bid. Graybug insiders will receive substantial benefits as part of change of control arrangements.
We are investigating the conduct of Graybug's board of directors, and whether they are (i) fulfilling their fiduciary duties to all shareholders, and (ii) obtaining a fair and reasonable price for Graybug.
If you own Graybug common stock and wish to obtain additional information, please contact Guri Ademi either at gademi@ademilaw.com or toll-free: 866-264-3995, or https://www.ademilaw.com/case/graybug-vision-inc.                       
We specialize in shareholder litigation involving buyouts, mergers, and individual shareholder rights throughout the country. For more information, please feel free to call us. Attorney advertising. Prior results do not guarantee similar outcomes.

Study is most comprehensive comparative-brand-personality study to date of U.S. brands
PHOENIX, Nov. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Zion & Zion, a full-service, global marketing agency, released a study that explored the relative brand personalities of 45 top U.S. brands. This study, the first in a series of four, introduces the industries and brands, sheds light on the different facets of brand personality in the Aaker scale and provides high-level results.
The Zion & Zion research team selected brands based on established brand value and industry leadership rankings. The survey included 9,309 adults, 18 years of age and up. Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity with one of the 45 brands, and those who answered with at least "somewhat familiar" were retained for the study resulting in a data set of 6,444 responses. The survey measured five brand personality dimensions: Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication and Ruggedness. Each dimension consists of multiple facets, and each facet consists of multiple traits. A total of 42 traits describes each brand's perceived personality.
"It's important to keep in mind that each brand has a unique profile that needs to be understood in relation to the brand's positioning and target segment," said Aric Zion, CEO of Zion & Zion. "Understanding a brand's personality is critical in building a persona or identifying what sets a brand apart from competitors and solidifies a brand's presence in the minds of consumers."
When comparing brand personality dimensions, we found that the top U.S. brands score highest on competence, followed by sincerity, excitement, and sophistication, while scoring lowest on ruggedness. Our interpretation of this finding is it takes establishing a brand as competent in its industry for a company to be considered a leading brand.
As a group, the brands had varying scores across brand personality dimensions - no brand scored high on all dimensions or low on all dimensions. For example, The Disney+ Streaming Service has the highest score on two dimensions (sincerity and excitement); Amazon leads on competence; Apple's TV+ leads on sophistication; and Nike leads on ruggedness. Facebook has the lowest score on two dimensions (competence and sincerity). Wells Fargo has the lowest excitement scores, Walmart is lowest on sophistication, and CVS is lowest on ruggedness.

CALGARY, AB, Nov. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - The Canadian Pacific (CP) Holiday Train program begins this week, with the first of two brightly decorated trains departing the Montreal area for the opening shows of the tour on Wednesday in Maine.

In the coming weeks, the two trains will make stops in communities on CP's rail network in eight U.S. states and six Canadian provinces.

"I have always had this someday dream of riding a train and playing some music and I can't believe that's actually happening this Christmas. I'm so excited for the Holiday Train," said Tenille Townes, one of eight headlining musicians touring with the train. "I can't wait to see so much of Canada from the snowy window view and meet up with our friends coming to the shows we are playing all along the way. And it's all in support of the food bank and making sure people are fed and taken care of this holiday season."

Black Hawk Mine Collapse Class Action Moves Forward Following Key State Supreme Court Ruling

Full text: Lawyers for Hideaway Hills homeowners: Class-action suit to proceed without delay
RAPID CITY, S.D., Nov. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- A class-action lawsuit on behalf of Hideaway Hills residents whose homes have been rendered worthless by unstable underground soil and an abandoned mine is moving forward thanks to a ruling by the South Dakota Supreme Court.
On Nov. 18, the court rejected the State of South Dakota's petition asking for the right to file an intermediate appeal of the certification of class action, which was issued in September.
The ruling clears the way for every homeowner in the Black Hawk, South Dakota-area neighborhood to receive official notice of the class certification in the coming days. The lawsuit seeks full compensation for homeowners based on the appraisal of each property before an April 2020 mine collapse created a large sinkhole near East Daisy Drive. Overnight, property values plummeted while state officials refused to acknowledge responsibility.
"This ruling shuts the door on any more delay tactics by the state, and we are ready to move forward," said Kathy Barrow, a partner at the Fox Rothschild law firm. "These residents have been in limbo for too long. A class-action sets the stage for a neighborhood-wide solution."
By law, all owners of 158 homes in the neighborhood are part of the lawsuit unless they opt out. In addition, homeowners can participate in the lawsuit without impacting any individual claims they might have against other defendants.
For generations, the state owned and operated gypsum mines in the region as part of its now-defunct for-profit cement company. According to the lawsuit, the state failed to properly remediate the underground soil and underground, pit and strip mines before the surface property was sold to a housing developer.
In September, Fox Rothschild attorneys won class certification after presenting findings from geological experts about the imminent dangers throughout the neighborhood. In granting certification, Circuit Court Judge Kevin Krull ruled in part that mounting separate lawsuits would be too costly and time-consuming for any individual homeowner. As a class-action, costs for geophysical and engineering studies and expert analysis are shared by all plaintiffs. 
The case is Andrew Morse and John and Emily Clarke et al. v. State of South Dakota , No. 46CIV-20-000295 in the Meade County 4th Judicial District.       
Fox Rothschild has grown to a 950-lawyer national law firm with 27 offices by focusing on client service and responsiveness and by attracting bright and creative lawyers who know how to deliver. More information at foxrothschild.com.

Full text: Funding slotted for 42 initiatives approved for state's Neighborhood Assistance Program
HARRISBURG, Pa., Nov. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- M&T Bank will provide more than $1.2 million to 42 initiatives aimed at serving distressed communities or low-income neighborhoods in Pennsylvania through the state's Neighborhood Assistance Program (NAP).
The bank's commitment to support the community improvement programs is among the $36 million Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf recently approved for NAP, which encourages private-sector investment in initiatives designed to improve underserved communities or address neighborhood problems.
The state program provides tax credits to businesses like M&T that donate capital to support the projects approved to use NAP funding for affordable housing, community services, crime prevention, education, job training, food access, blight, special population issues, veterans' initiatives or long-term community revitalization. A project can be sponsored by more than one business, and not all projects that apply for NAP funding are approved by the state.
"M&T supports the Neighborhood Assistance Program as an innovative way to spur community development and revitalization throughout Pennsylvania," said Gail D'Angelo, M&T's community reinvestment manager for Pennsylvania. "We look forward to working with our partner organizations that were approved for NAP this year and witnessing the tremendous impact they will make in their respective communities."
M&T's funding is concentrated largely in the state's southeast, Philadelphia and central areas, where the bank will contribute $395,000, $300,000 and $295,000, respectively, to 30 projects approved for NAP in fiscal 2023, which ends June 30, 2023.
The projects M&T will help support through NAP include:
- $30,000 for Affordable Housing Centers of Pennsylvania to provide housing counseling services to residents of West Philadelphia, where mortgage foreclosures are up and homeownership among Black residents is down;
- $50,000 for Diamond City Partnership, an economic development alliance working to transform downtown Wilkes-Barre;
- $25,000 to HDC Mid-Atlantic for the ongoing development of its College Avenue affordable housing project in Lancaster;
- $25,000 to Kutztown Small Business Development Center to assist entrepreneurs and small-business owners gain access to the resources and information they need to launch or grow their businesses;
- $10,000 for Midwest Food Bank to provide food rescue and distribution to more than 137,000 hungry individuals in Central Pennsylvania; and,
- $50,000 for WEPA Empowerment Center to establish a bilingual community-based workforce development center in the city of Lebanon.

M&T Bank has participated in the NAP program for numerous years, with increased commitments in each of the past three years. In fiscal 2022, which ended June 30, the bank provided $836,000 to 35 projects throughout the state.

Full text: SANTA FE SPRINGS, Calif., Nov. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- At Angelus Direct the motto is 'create what you can't have,' and this holiday-themed leather coaster craft by customizer Sophie Saldana is a great example. If you're looking for a relaxing craft to work on this holiday season or want to create a custom gift, this is the perfect project.
 
At Angelus Direct the motto and trademark is 'Create What You Can't Have™' Sophie recently walked us through the steps to create these coasters and has some advice for how to make them your own. When asked about other possible themes, Sophie says "coasters are really easy to make, so getting creative with them would be a breeze! They can be cut and painted into fun foods like donuts, since that's the same shape as a regular round coaster. But it adds a cool twist!"
The first step is doing the right prep work. With these coasters that means preparing the leather for painting with Angelus Deglazer to remove any finish.
Sophie chose Thanksgiving and Christmas-themed shapes, but you can do any shape that lends itself to a coaster. Create your own freehand sketch or use a stencil, just make sure the shape is larger than the bottom of a glass. Once you have your shapes use graphite paper to transfer the designs to the leather and cut out your coasters.
Painting the outlines of your designs in black will act as a guide while adding each color. While you can use any colors you want, Sophie likes to mix each color with a base of Angelus Flat White and a few drops of Angelus Grey to flatten the brightness . Because the leather is so thick painting the edges of the coasters gives them a finished look.
To protect the leather coasters her final step is applying 4-Coat. Sophie chooses this product because "Angelus 4-Coat is my absolute favorite finisher at the moment, since it's so protective. I've painted and sealed a few things with it and it's lasted through some wear and tear, which is great!"
Once your coasters are dry, they're ready for your holiday table. Sophie plans on using them this Thanksgiving when she hosts some of her friends and family. " The coasters are definitely going to come in handy when we bring out the sparkling cider," says Sophie.

LOGAN TOWNSHIP, N.J.,  Nov. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Leading e-commerce parcel carrier LaserShip/OnTrac has opened a brand-new 326,973 square foot sort center in the greater Philadelphia metropolitan area and invested in automation to increase capacity and empower retailers with faster delivery at a lower cost.
"Our continued investment in network infrastructure is the direct result of our retailers' need to diversify their carrier mix and reach their customers with faster, reliable last-mile delivery," says Josh Dinneen, Chief Commercial Officer of LaserShip/OnTrac. "We're excited to open our new sort center ahead of this year's holiday shopping season, and we look forward to welcoming more members of the community to our team."
The state-of-the-art sort center, located at 701 Crossroads Boulevard in Logan Township, New Jersey, will facilitate deliveries to over 250 million consumers across LaserShip/OnTrac's hub-and-spoke residential e-commerce delivery network, which spans 30 states and Washington, D.C. LaserShip/OnTrac has also invested in a fully automated small package sorter to increase the facility's sorting capacity to 31,000 packages per hour, effectively doubling the capacity in the densely populated tri-state area of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.
"Providing faster delivery services is extremely important to the region's businesses to stay competitive and serve the needs of their customers," said Janet Garraty, executive director of the Gloucester County Chamber of Commerce, Gloucester County, NJ. "The new sort center will support the supply chain operations for many of our region's businesses. We look forward to welcoming LaserShip/OnTrac to our community."
In addition to expanding its infrastructure, LaserShip/OnTrac plans to add over 400 full-time and seasonal workers.
The opening of the new sort center will enable retailers to take advantage of LaserShip/OnTrac's coast-to-coast delivery service, which helps them reach consumers in the country's most populated regions with faster, reliable home delivery. Launched as a product of the companies' 2021 merger and in response to overwhelming customer feedback for a proven alternative to national carriers, the transcontinental network connects LaserShip and OnTrac's complementary East and West Coast delivery footprints to move packages across the country in as little as three days.

Full text: Average premiums for Medicare Advantage and Part D plans are up for the first time in four years
Demand for $0 premium Medicare Advantage plans may have crested
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today eHealth, Inc. (Nasdaq: EHTH) (eHealth.com), released a report providing a snapshot of costs and plan selection trends during Medicare's Annual Enrollment Period (AEP) for 2023 coverage. The report examines the coverage choices Medicare beneficiaries are actively making for themselves for the coming year.
eHealth's report presents an analysis of premiums and plan selection trends among Medicare beneficiaries shopping at eHealth in the first half of Medicare's current Annual Enrollment Period. eHealth is a leading online private health insurance marketplace offering free-of-charge personalized plan recommendations from competing insurers nationwide.
For additional context on Medicare Advantage trends, the report also includes findings highlighted in an eHealth survey of more than 2,800 Medicare Advantage enrollees conducted in May of 2022.
Key findings:
- Average premiums for Medicare Advantage plans are up for the first time in four years: $7 is the average monthly premium for Medicare Advantage plans selected by Medicare beneficiaries in the first half of AEP, after three years in the $5 to $4 range.
- Demand for $0 premium Medicare Advantage plans may have crested: 84% of those selecting Medicare Advantage plans in the first half of AEP chose $0 premium plans, compared to 88% in the same period last year.
- Average premiums for stand-alone Medicare Part D Prescription Drug plans are higher: $31 is the average monthly premium for stand-alone Medicare Part D plans selected in the first half of AEP, up from $21 last year.

Read the full report.
"This is the first increase in average premiums we've tracked in four years," said eHealth CEO Fran Soistman. "It may be driven by a number of factors, including carrier premium increases related to drug costs, a leveling out of demand for $0 premium Medicare Advantage plans, or consumers opting for higher premium plans to hedge against out-of-pocket costs during a period of inflation. In our July survey, for example, 95% of Medicare respondents told us they worried about inflation's impact on their health care costs."
Findings from eHealth's report are based on submitted applications for Medicare Advantage plans and stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plans received by eHealth between October 15 and November 8, 2022, with comparisons to data previously published by eHealth for approximately the same period in prior years.
No information relevant to eHealth's financial performance should be drawn from this report. Like other insurance brokers, eHealth is compensated on a fixed per-member basis for Medicare Advantage and Part D plans, as regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and on a percentage of premium basis for most Medicare Supplement plans.
About eHealth
For more than 25 years, eHealth, Inc. (Nasdaq: EHTH) has served American consumers with innovative technology and licensed agent support to help them find health insurance solutions that fit their personal needs. Through its proprietary health insurance marketplace at eHealth.com and eHealthMedicare.com, eHealth has connected more than eight million members with quality, affordable coverage. eHealth offers Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, Medicare Part D, individual, family, small business, and ancillary plans from approximately 200 health insurance companies nationwide.

- World Benchmarking Alliance's 2022 Financial System Benchmark assessed 400 financial institutions around the globe
- Focus on governance, planetary boundaries and human rights and social issues

TORONTO, Nov. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - BMO has been recognized as the world's top ranked financial institution by the World Benchmarking Alliance's new global benchmark (WBA) for helping make progress in support of a just and sustainable economy.
The WBA, whose mission is to advance the UN sustainable development goals, ranks 2,000 of the world's most influential companies on their performance against several industry benchmarks. The 2022 Financial System Benchmark, announced at COP27, independently assesses 400 financial institutions from around the globe in three areas: governance, planetary boundaries and human rights and social issues.
"As a purpose-driven organization, BMO is committed to helping to build a thriving economy and a sustainable future and eliminate barriers to inclusion," said Michael Torrance, Chief Sustainability Officer, BMO. "We're honoured that the progress we are making in these areas – which includes our climate ambition to be our clients' lead partner in the transition to a net zero world – is being recognized. We know there is still much work to be done, and we remain committed to our purpose to Boldly Grow the Good in business and life ."
The WBA noted BMO's strong performance across all three measurement areas, noting it is one of the few financial institutions that has set targets for both environmental and social impact of its financing activities and tracks progress against them. Additionally, BMO has many offerings and programs that are supporting progress for a more just and sustainable economy, including:
- Committing $5 billion over five years to address key barriers faced by minority businesses, communities and families in the United States
- Supporting women business owners  in Canada with a $5-billion commitment
- Acting as a joint-lead manager for the Government of Canada's inaugural Green Bond transaction
- Being the first financial institution in the world to implement the Mastercard True Name feature, enabling people to use their true first name on their personal debit and ATM cards without the requirement of a legal name change

BMO announced its Climate Ambition in March 2021, including the launch of the BMO Climate Institute, with a focus on being their clients' lead partner in the transition to a net-zero world. This goal built on a previous commitment to mobilize $300 billion in sustainable lending and underwriting to companies pursuing sustainable outcomes by 2025. In 2021 BMO established a dedicated Energy Transition Group, to support clients' pursuit of opportunities driven by the increasing momentum of the global economy's shift in production and consumption of energy.
BMO's sustainability leadership has been recognized on a number of global rankings, including the Corporate Knights' Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations, Dow Jones Sustainability Indices World Index, and Ethisphere Institute's list of the World's Most Ethical Companies.

The Deal Will See QatarEnergy Supply 4 million tons of LNG to Sinopec Every year, and the Two Sides Carry out Integrated Cooperation on the Expansion Project of the Northern Gas Field
BEIJING, Nov. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (HKG: 0386, "Sinopec") and QatarEnergy have signed a long-term Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) purchase and sales agreement for the annual supply of four million tons of LNG to Sinopec. Both parties will work together on Qatar's North Field Expansion Project ("the Project").
The 27-year long-term LNG purchase and sale agreement is an important part of the integrated cooperation between the two sides. Sinopec Chairman Ma Yongsheng and Qatari Minister of State for Energy Affairs, President and CEO of QatarEnergy, H.E. Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi, formally signed the agreement together during an online ceremony.
China and Qatar have enjoyed friendly and close ties while building synergies in the energy sector, Ma said. The healthy level of diplomacy creates a favorable environment for both sides to continuously deepen their cooperation.
"The signing of this agreement aligns with Sinopec's adherence to green, low-carbon, safe, and sustainable development," Ma said. "The LNG supply will help meet the demand for natural gas in the Chinese market, but also further optimize China's energy mix while enhancing the security, stability, and reliability of energy supply."
"We are delighted to have reached this agreement, which will further strengthen the excellent bilateral relationship between China and Qatar," said H.E. Mr. Al-Kaabi. "The agreement will help to meet China's growing demand for clean energy. This cooperation, which spans different fields and will last for 27 years, marks an extraordinary and exciting new chapter of cooperation between the two sides.
Commissioning of the Northern Gas Field Expansion Project is slated for 2026. This agreement is the second long-term LNG purchase and sale agreement signed between Sinopec and QatarEnergy, and the first long-term LNG purchase and sale agreement for the Project.

Full text: "The Life of a PK" from Christian Faith Publishing author Calvin Suttles is a heartfelt message of hope to others who have faced similar challenges as the author recounts what life was like growing up, healing from past hurts, and the hopes still held for future generations.
MEADVILLE, Pa., Nov. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- "The Life of a PK": an encouraging discussion of faith, family, and breaking out of past traumas. "The Life of a PK" is the creation of published author Calvin Suttles, a dynamic communicator and influencer with a passion to inspire this generation. He and his wife, Lorna, with whom he shares three children, are assistant pastors at Grace City Church in Indiana.
Suttles shares, "Do you feel like you didn't have a choice on whether or not you wanted to be brought up in church? Do you feel like your church has caused you pain? Do you feel like no one understands what it feels like to be a pastor's or leader's kid?
"In Life of a PK, you'll discover your calling, destiny, and purpose in life. You will be able to relate to the author as he shares his testimony on church hurt, sexual abuse, and trust. You will be able to be healed emotionally, spiritually, and mentally. Your life will change, and you will have a different perspective on God. Most importantly, you will discover that you are not alone. You will discover that you're born with a purpose, and no one can take that away from you. Despite of the obstacles, pain, and failures that life throws at you, you can overcome."
Published by Christian Faith Publishing, Calvin Suttles's new book will resonate with many who have faced sexual abuse from a young age as Suttles explores how he overcame the lasting effects of the broken trust that resulted.
Suttles brings readers a powerful message of encouragement and hope within the pages of this articulate work.
Consumers can purchase "The Life of a PK" at traditional brick & mortar bookstores, or online at Amazon.com, Apple iTunes store, or Barnes and Noble.

Full text: NEW YORK , Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pomerantz LLP is investigating claims on behalf of investors of Barclays PLC (""Barclays" or the "Company") (NYSE: BCS). Such investors are advised to contact Robert S. Willoughby at newaction@pomlaw.com or 888-476-6529, ext. 7980.
The investigation concerns whether Barclays and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. 
[Click here for information about joining the class action]  
On March 28, 2022, Barclays announced that Barclays Bank PLC ("BBPLC") had issued approximately $15.2 billion in unregistered securities under an August 2019 shelf registration statement, that BBPLC would commence a rescission offer for those unregistered securities, and that Barclays expected the rescission losses to be approximately £450m. 
On this news, Barclays' American Depositary Receipt ("ADR") price fell $0.96 per ADR, or 10.61%, to close at $8.09 per ADR on March 28, 2022. 
Then, on July 28, 2022, Barclays issued interim financial results for the quarter ending June 30, 2022 and announced for the first time that BBPLC had also over-issued unregistered securities under a second BBPLC shelf registration statement. The July 28, 2022 financial results announcement also informed investors that Barclays had provisioned "£1,592m [approximately $1.940 billion] (December 2021: £220m) related to the overissuance of structured notes and £165m [approximately $201 million] (December 2021: nil) related to liabilities that could be incurred arising out of ongoing discussions in respect of a potential SEC resolution." 
On this news, Barclays' ADR price fell $0.41 per ADR, or 5.2%, to close at $7.48 per ADR on July 28, 2022.
Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 85 years later, Pomerantz continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomlaw.com.

- Telluride, Sportage, K5, Soul and Rio earn J.D. Power awards for having the highest residual value within their respective segments
- Kia is the most improved mass market brand year over year

IRVINE, Calif., Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Last week, Kia took home the highest number of model awards – five – in the J.D. Power 2023 U.S. ALG Residual Value Awards. The segment wins by Telluride (Midsize SUVs with 3-row seating), Sportage (Compact SUVs), K5 (Midsize Cars), Soul (Micro SUVs), and Rio (Small Cars), led Kia to the best year-over-year improvement of any mass market brand in the annual evaluation.
"Kia is a brand on the move, with more models predicted to hold their value within their respective segments than any mass market brand," said Steven Center, COO and EVP, Kia America. "Resale value is one of the most important purchase considerations, and from rugged and capable SUVs to sporty sedans, the latest J.D. Power U.S. ALG Residual Value Awards are the latest demonstration of the strength and breadth of Kia's lineup."
The U.S. J.D. Power ALG Residual Value Awards are the automotive industry standard in recognizing vehicle models projected to hold the highest percentage of their manufacturer's suggested retail price following a three-year period of ownership. This value retention is a key variable in the lease cost of a vehicle, underscoring an automaker's success in the areas of long-term quality and design, as well as the overall desirability of automotive brands and their models.
"This year's achievement by Kia speaks volumes about how far the brand has come," said Eric Lyman, vice president of ALG, the division of J.D. Power recognized as the industry benchmark of automotive residual value projections. "The marketplace is acknowledging that Kia has a very strong product lineup in terms of design, quality and residual values. Kia has become a force to be reckoned with."

Security Teams Must Better Collaborate with Employees to Create More Effective Policies, Says Info-Tech Research Group

Security success comes from employee input and enhanced training on policies.
TORONTO, Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -  As data breaches and security incidents continue to increase, research indicates that security policies do not shape good employee behavior or security-conscious practices. To assist security leaders in enhancing their overall security posture with a defensible and prescriptive policy suite , global IT research and advisory firm Info-Tech Research Group has published a new industry blueprint titled Develop and Deploy Security Policies .
Adhering to security policies is rarely a priority to users as compliance often feels like interference with daily workflow, and for many organizations, these policies do not have the desired effect.
"A policy for policy's sake is useless if it isn't being used to ensure proper processes are followed," says Danny Hammond , security research analyst at Info-Tech Research Group. "A policy should exist for more than just checking a requirement box. Policies need to be quantified, qualified, and enforced for them to be relevant."
Info-Tech's research shows that employees are not paying attention to policies, which could be due to a lack of awareness and understanding of the security policy's purpose, how it benefits the organization, and the importance of compliance when policies are distributed. Furthermore, informal, un-rationalized, ad hoc policies do not explicitly outline responsibilities, are rarely comprehensive, and are difficult to implement, revise, and maintain.
The blueprint explains that creating good policies is only half the solution. To nurture an effective security policy and increase engagement, organizations must make a concerted approach to developing a policy lifecycle that involves stakeholders from development to deployment, review, and monitoring.
"No published framework is going to be a perfect fit for any organization, so take the time to compare business operations and culture with security requirements to determine which ones apply to keep the organization secure," explains Hammond.
Info-Tech's blueprint outlines a policy management lifecycle that will enable leaders to keep policies current, effective, and compliant. The recommended lifecycle includes four key steps:
- Define Security Policy Program: Generate a roadmap to guide the order of policy development based on organizational policy requirements and the target audience.

- Develop and Implement Policy Suite: Policies must be reasonable, auditable, enforceable, and measurable. Policy items that meet these requirements will have a higher level of adherence.

- Communicate Policy Program: Awareness and training on security policies should be targeted and must be relevant to the employee's job. Employees will be more attentive and willing to incorporate what they learn if they feel the training was designed to help them.

- Measure Policy Program: Gaining feedback on policy compliance is important for updates and adaptation, as well as monitoring policy alignment to business objectives.
According to the research and expert insights, while management support is essential to initiating a strong security posture, allowing employees to provide input on the development of security policies will lead to easier incorporation of the policies into the daily routines of workers, with less resistance. The security team will also be viewed as less of an enforcer and more of a partner.

Full text: Taniesha Thomas has been selected for Populus Group's brand new role as Head of DE&I.
TROY, Mich., Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Earlier this year, Populus Group added an exciting and necessary role to their community – Head of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I). As a Minority- and Veteran-owned company, DE&I has always been part of who they are and drives their core purpose – that everyone deserves the opportunity to succeed.
Like many organizations, they've created a more intentional focus on our DE&I efforts over the past few years, and adding this role is one of the key commitments they've made for 2022. Populus Group announces the promotion of Taniesha Thomas to the role of Head of DE&I.
Mario Lambert, Populus Group's Vice President of Sales, states: "We are thrilled to have Taniesha's authentic voice and leadership in this role to help us elevate our impact in DE&I".
When asked, "In your opinion, what's the most important problem to solve in the DE&I space right now?" Taniesha Thomas responds, "One of the most important problems to solve right now is making sure we take the topic of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion from a moment to a movement. We've seen an increase of DE&I professionals being brought into organizations off the heels of some very turbulent social justice events happening around the nation. It's important that we lean into these roles as strategic advisors and continue to move our organizations away from being reactive and instead being proactive and visionary."
As Head of DE&I, Thomas will be responsible for building out PG's Employee Resource Group (ERG) program by aligning them to their 3 focus pillars: People, Partners, and Purpose. She will also harness DE&I data for assessment and transparency, both internally and externally. In addition, she will work closely with Populus Group's DE&I Council to reignite partnerships in the community, and ultimately help serve underprivileged youth and veterans both locally and nationally.
"Taniesha is an extremely passionate person, especially when it comes to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive community for everyone here at PG and extending that beyond our walls to our customers, partners, and contract employees" shares Karen Philbrick, VP of HR at Populus Group. "We couldn't be more excited to have her leading the charge."

Mr. Meisong Lai, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ZTO, commented, "Despite macroeconomic softness and COVID-19 related disruptions, ZTO once again achieved volume and profit growth for the quarter.  Our 6.4 billion parcel volume helped to increase our market share by 1.3 points to 22.1%, and the adjusted net income grew 63.1% to 1.9 billion while we held our leading position on the customer satisfaction scoreboard. While price competition stabilized in the marketplace, our internally focused initiatives to enhance operational excellence and earnings quality have generated enhancements to our topline and bottom-line. Granular level of assessments of cost coverage, price competitiveness and operating efficiencies allowed us to respond to problems firsthand as well as establishing systemic solutions. Further, many of these solutions are inclusive of our network partners' interests so that the entire network becomes more profitable with improved capabilities and cohesiveness to address external challenges and seize opportunities ahead."
Mr. Lai added, "Throughout the first half of the fourth quarter, we saw industry volume soften during the ecommerce promotional period, followed by fluctuations.  While there remain uncertainties in the near term, we are hopeful for improvements from here on, and we are confident for the positive longer term prospects. The market landscape for express delivery industry in China have been unfolding, and we saw clear divergence of the major players.  The stronger ones will scale up faster and grow profit while weaker ones would likely stagnate or exit. Our focus is on being the best we can during uncertain times. Opportunities awaits those who are well prepared."
Ms. Huiping Yan, Chief Financial Officer of ZTO, commented, "Our core express delivery ASP grew 9.9% or 12 cents year-on-year. Unit operating costs remain stable despite weaker volume, and together with SG&A cost productivity, our operating margin rate improved by 5.9 points for the quarter.  Cash flow from operating activities increased 58.0% to 2.8 billion. Capital spending was 2.1 billion mainly for land use rights, sorting hub construction and automation."
Ms. Yan added, "We have always strived to achieve optimal balance between quality of service, volume growth, and earnings. Through consistent equitable sharing of burden and benefits, we have built a partner network that is unified under common goals and objectives.  Widening our market share lead is of even greater strategic importance now, and we are self-assured to continue to  deliver on our strategies. Even though our annual volume guidance was modified given external market conditions, our conviction to achieve at least one percentage point market share gain for the year remains strong."

Business Outlook
Taking into account the current market conditions and the uncertainties associated with macro economy and COVID-19, the Company revises its previously stated annual guidance. Parcel volume for 2022 is expected to be in the range of 24.30 billion to 24.74 billion, representing a 9% to 11% increase year over year. Relative to the entire industry performance, the Company is confident to achieve at least one percentage point increase in its market share for the entire year. Such estimates represent management's current and preliminary view, which are subject to change.
(1)    EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as net income before depreciation, amortization, interest expenses and income tax expenses which management aims to better represent the underlying business operations.
Company Share Purchase
On November 14, 2018, the Company announced a share repurchase program whereby ZTO was authorized to repurchase its own Class A ordinary shares in the form of ADSs with an aggregate value of up to US$500 million during an 18-month period thereafter. On March 13, 2021, the board of directors of the Company approved the extension of the active share repurchase program to June 30, 2021. On March 31, 2021, the board of directors has approved changes to the share repurchase program, increasing the aggregate value of shares that may be repurchased from US$500 million to US$1 billion and extending the effective time by two years through June 30, 2023. On November 17, 2022, the board of directors has approved further changes to the share repurchase program, increasing the aggregate value of shares that may be repurchased from US$1 billion to US$1.5 billion and extending the effective time by one year through June 30, 2024.The Company expects to fund the repurchases out of its existing cash balance. As of September 30, 2022, the Company has purchased an aggregate of 36,074,242 ADSs at an average purchase price of US$25.21, including repurchase commissions.
Exchange Rate
This announcement contains translation of certain Renminbi amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of readers. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from Renminbi to U.S. dollars were made at the exchange rate of RMB 7.1135 to US$ 1.00, the noon buying rate on September 30, 2022 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Systems.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per American depositary share, and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per American depositary share attributable to ordinary shareholders, each a non-GAAP financial measure, in evaluating ZTO's operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes.
Reconciliations of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to its U.S. GAAP financial measures are shown in tables at the end of this earnings release, which provide more details about the non-GAAP financial measures.
The Company believes that EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per American depositary share help identify underlying trends in ZTO's business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of the expenses and gains that the Company includes in income from operations and net income. The Company believes that EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per American depositary share provide useful information about its operating results, enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by ZTO's management in its financial and operational decision-making.
EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per American depositary share should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to net income or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance. Investors are encouraged to compare the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per American depositary share presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to ZTO's data. ZTO encourages investors and others to review the Company's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

A Visa study found almost 75% of fraud and data theft involves e-commerce companies. Adherence to and compliance with cybersecurity standards such as PCI DSS, a critical path for the protection of sensitive data for businesses and accelerating adoption and trust in the digital economy.
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Kicking off with Amazon's Prime Day in October, to the holiday season, to the milestones of Black Friday and CyberMonday, the last 100 days of the year are the biggest retail sales season in the world.
In the United States alone, Adobe Analytics predicted that online holiday sales will reach $209.7 billion through December 31st, 2022, representing 2.5% year-over-year growth.
According to Bloomberg, the United States will lead Christmas sales in the continent with 59% of transactions, followed by countries such as Brazil (13%), Mexico (6%) and Peru (1.6%).
E-commerce has come to reign among consumer preferences, convenience, choice and with that same token becoming the launchpad of attacks and fraud by cybercriminals.  According to the Visa Biannual Threats Report study, up to the first half of 2022, almost 75% of the fraud and data breach cases investigated by Visa teams worldwide involved e-commerce companies.
"Targeting e-commerce platforms and third-party code integrations are among the most common tactics used by threat actors conducting digital theft attacks,", Visa's report notes. "These e-commerce attack tactics, techniques and procedures confirm that threat actors target supply chains and third-party service providers with a high frequency and show continued interest in payment account data and personally identifiable information (PII)."
Ensure the protection of your electronic payment transactions
Cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and, as statistics show, payment transactions in e-commerce environments is already a key focus for cybercrime targets.
"There is no silver bullet when it comes to fraud. You can implement the best systems in the world, but they still rely on human beings who have exploitable blind spots. That's why educating your consumers and employees is imperative to stopping fraud. Making sure every link in your supply chain institutes a zero-trust architecture helps combat fraud before it starts, but it only takes one text message, LinkedIn message or email for a fraudster to gain access to your systems. Making sure everyone knows the signs is the best way to stop fraud," says Michael Jabbara, Global Head of Fraud Services at Visa.
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) is a standard governed by the principal card brands (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discovery and JCB) and add value in protecting cardholder data. In this regard, all merchants that process, store or transmit credit
environment.
Regarding the state of adoption of standards for the protection of data in electronic transactions, the 2022 Verizon Payment Security Report (2022 PSR) confirms a significant improvement in PCI DSS compliance since 2020, with 43.4% of organizations aligned with the regulations versus the 27.9% reported in 2019. However, this diagnostic revealed that more than half (56.7 %) of organizations failed interim validation assessments due to omissions of one or more security controls.
Further strengthening the payment security landscape on the table for CISOs and other organizational security professionals, the PCI SSC standard recently instituted one of the most significant updates to the DSS since its launch in 2004: PCI DSS v4.0 will go into effect in 2024.
"Security leaders must focus their attention and resources to catch up with these new requirements. The threat of credit card fraud and information theft in the global retail sector has never been more prevalent. PCI compliance, governance and risk management practices are imperative for all organizations that interact with cardholder data", said Héctor Guillermo Martínez, President GM Sectec.
GM Sectec, the global leader in cybersecurity, and Visa, global leader in digital payments, have strengthened their partnership to facilitate fraud prevention, cyber defense and cybersecurity best practices in the Latin America and Caribbean region. To this end, GM Sectec in partnership with Cybersource, a Visa solution, will now offer payment and risk management services supported by GM Sectec's cybersecurity expertise.
"One of the biggest concerns for businesses and organizations of all types, sizes and industries is how to protect the personal data and sensitive information of hundreds of thousands of users, customers and consumers who rely on them to conduct their daily transactions through various channels and platforms, many of them digital. The strengthening of our partnership with Visa, will allow organizations of all types across the payment system to engage cyber defense best practices with the support of a trusted cyber defense leader," said Hector Guillermo Martinez, president of GM Sectec.

The key milestone demonstrates the company's relentless commitment to innovation and solidifies its strong patents portfolio as an industry leader
DETROIT, Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Baraja , creator of breakthrough Spectrum-Scan™ LiDAR technology for autonomous vehicles, today announces a significant IP milestone of securing 100 patent assets worldwide — proving its unrivaled focus in developing new technologies to further strengthen the company's position in leading the future of autonomous vehicles globally.
With this latest development, Baraja's patent protection now spans eight jurisdictions and four continents including the United States, Europe, China, Japan, and Korea, to cover major automotive markets and origins. The company's patent portfolio is application-agnostic, as use of LiDAR sensors is ubiquitous in other autonomy industries such as robotics, mining, heavy machinery, trucking, last-mile delivery and infrastructure.
" This milestone demonstrates the raw innovation capacity and perseverance of Baraja's brightest minds, but also our commitment to building a robust, protected intellectual property portfolio ," said Cibby Pulikkaseril, Chief Technology Officer at Baraja.
" Having our advanced technology validated by global patent authorities, we continue to cement Baraja as a pioneer in delivering unmatched LiDAR solutions that deliver the utmost accuracy, reliability and ease of manufacturability for our strategic partners, no matter which autonomous space they are in. The self-driving revolution is soon to be a reality with our inventive IP and technological leadership at the forefront of the industry."
LiDAR sensing is seen by many as a key enabling technology for autonomous driving. However, as most other LiDAR companies use mechanical steering with large mechanical devices, Baraja has a competitive edge in that its Spectrum-Scan™ LiDAR technology can miniaturize the system, decrease costs and boost reliability.
Baraja's patent portfolio boasts more than 25 patent families, each representing unique concepts to improve its LiDAR sensors. Baraja Spectrum-Scan™ beam steering, coupled with RMCW ranging technology, enables unrivalled interference immunity in LiDAR operation. This speaks to Baraja's significantly improved performance in the real-world environment, as interference from other LiDARs and the sun is negated by its code verification system.
The company's coaxial transceiver architecture offers effortless alignment between light transmission and reception for blur-resistant LiDAR point clouds — showcasing the ease of manufacturability when Baraja needs to scale production up. Spectrum-Scan™-enabled foveation allows responsive selection of the best LiDAR vision acuity on-the-fly, which results in optimized performance in various use-case scenarios such as improved safety in automotive situations.
Overall, these improvements lead to better accuracy, expanded capabilities and scalable manufacturability of Baraja's products. Volume production of high-quality LiDAR sensors will ultimately drive down their costs and inspire further use-cases.
"Baraja's continuing efforts in developing and protecting intellectual property are central to its mission in building a safer autonomous future. Our track record of achieving world-first innovations is another step towards that goal, and we look forward to seeing what we will achieve in the future," adds Pulikkaseril.
About Baraja
Baraja is building the future of LiDAR to enable the autonomous future. With its revolutionary Spectrum-Scan™ LiDAR technology, Baraja gives leading automotive companies a solid state system in the fast axis that sets a new benchmark in precision and reliability. 
Baraja was founded in 2016 by telecommunications engineers Federico Collarte and Cibby Pulikkaseril, who discovered a way to use the industry's proven optical fiber + photonics technology to solve the problems faced by legacy LiDAR. Baraja is backed by Sequoia, Blackbird Ventures, Hitachi Construction Machinery and Main Sequence Ventures.

This January, Motorcar Cavalcade Returns for a Second Year with Some of the World's Rarest Cars and a VIP Judging Panel
MIAMI, Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Motorcar Cavalcade , the must-attend event for every automobile enthusiast from connoisseur to the car-curious, announces its preliminary lineup of celebrity judges and a peek into the vibrant collection of the automobiles, from iconic vintage classics to modern exotics. The event, now in its second year, will be held on the lush fairway of the JW Marriott Turnberry Resort's golf course on January 15th in Aventura, Miami.
The 2023 event judges are VIP celebrities, sports stars and some of the world's leading automotive figures including Motorsports Hall of Fame racing legends Lyn St. James and Tommy Kendall . Other influential individuals have been confirmed as judges such as former Miami Heat basketball player Alonzo Mourning , auction house Phillips Watches' Head of Americas Paul Boutros, and General Motors Designer Wayne Kady , to name a few.
"This year's Motorcar Cavalcade will be nothing short of incredible," says Jason Wenig, Motorcar Cavalcade Co-Executive Director . "We have a lineup of cars never-before-seen in South Florida and are thrilled to have our esteemed judges including former female race car driver Lyn St. James involved in the Concours." Lyn will be the Saturday Car Rally Honoree and lead the procession. She will also be involved in a "Fireside Chat" during the event to talk about women in motorsports and in leadership roles in the car world and beyond.
Adding a Hollywood touch to this year's Concours is the extremely rare yet distinctly recognizable 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder , used in the 1986 movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off and brought to the show by Hagerty. Laurent-Perrier will host a lounge serving the brand's fine champagne while also showcasing their pink 1968 Citroen DS , aptly named "Bubbles," which coincides with the year in which the champagne house launched their Cuvée Rosé. Other sponsors include Warren Henry Auto Group, Regent Cruises, Fraser Yachts, Hennessey Performance Engineering , and Hagerty . In an exciting debut, Hennessey will unveil its new Venom 5 Roadster , a bespoke hypercar engineered to exceed 300 mph as the world's most exhilarating open-air driving experience.
The full list of participating vehicles will be announced closer to the event, with this year's impressive collection of cars expected to closely align with the calibre of winning vehicles from last year's show, such as the 1921 Kissel Gold Bug (Executive Committee Award), a 1934 Bugatti Type 57 Cabriole t (Docent Judge & Cockpit Award), a 1961 Ferrari 250 GT Cabriolet (ALZ Sponsor Award), and the 1933 Rolls Royce Phantom II (Best in Show - Classic & Lights Award). Highlights of the modern marvels were the 2020 Apollo IE (Paint Award), 2020 Koenigsegg Regera (Finish Award), and 2021 Pagani Huayra Roadster BC (Best in Show – Modern & Mirrors Awards).
Motorcar Cavalcade kicks off on January 14th with a Speed & Style Rally, a driving tour for participants to take their vehicles for a spin as part of an award-ribbon event. Upwards of 40 thoroughbred cars and passengers will be treated to a magnificent sightseeing journey through Miami, with stops at exclusive venues, allowing onlookers to witness the beauty and majesty of a Cavalcade of Cars . The tour concludes in grand style at the prestigious Bentley Residences for an intimate brunch.
Limited ticketing is available to the general public for $575 for the Sunday Concours, giving attendees an opportunity for a bit of overindulgence with all gourmet cuisine, cocktails and champagne included during the all-day event.

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --
WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Block, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) between November 4, 2021 and April 4, 2022, both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"), of the important December 12, 2022 lead plaintiff deadline .
SO WHAT:  If you purchased Block securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.
WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Block class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=9176 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than December 12, 2022 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Block lacked adequate protocols restricting access to customer sensitive information; (2) as a result, a former employee was able to download certain reports of Block's subsidiary, Cash App Investing, containing full customer names and brokerage account numbers, as well as brokerage portfolio value, brokerage portfolio holdings and/or stock trading activity; (3) as a result, Block was reasonably likely to suffer significant damage, including reputational harm; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, defendant's positive statements about Block's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
To join the Block class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=9176 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.
No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Full text: Advocates for Faith and Freedom, 951-304-7583, media@Faith-Freedom.com
SANTA CLARITA, Calif., Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Ninth Circuit has ruled that Election Integrity Project® California (EIPCa) and recent and future congressional candidates have standing to challenge the Constitutionality of California's election laws, regulations, policies and procedures that have weakened or removed integrity from the election process. Though the Constitution gives authority to state legislators to pass laws to manage elections and process ballots, EIPCa asserts they do not have carte blanche authority to pass laws that diminish the value of the lawfully cast ballots.
Ninth Circuit Rules Election Integrity Project®California has Standing to Challenge Constitutionality of California's The decision remanded the lawsuit to the lower court for discovery, which is the next phase of the litigation.
Over the last decade California has passed laws, orders and regulations that have led to massive irregularities, culminating in the 2020 election, when Governor Newsom authorized mailing a ballot to all "active" registrants on the voter rolls and former Secretary of State Alex Padilla gutted signature verification requirements. EIPCa received over 700 affidavits signed under penalty of perjury from EIPCa-trained observers who consistently reported election workers not adequately verifying signatures and, in some cases, counting ballots without signatures.
Because neither the state legislature nor Alex Padilla required uniform and secure vote casting and counting procedures, uneven procedures were applied across counties.  EIPCa and its co-plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against Governor Newsom, the Attorney General, the Secretary of State, and thirteen country registrars.
"This lawsuit is monumental because it is the first to challenge the constitutionality of California's election laws and procedures, and we are the first to get past standing," says Mariah Gondeiro, the lead attorney who works for Advocates for Faith and Freedom. "If we win, California will be required to enforce secure and uniform vote casting and vote counting procedures."
"For over a decade, Election Integrity Project® California has researched and documented every aspect of California's election process and identified how these laws transformed an Election Day into a 60-day election season fraught with easy to manipulate procedures," says Linda Paine, President of EIPCa. "We are now seeing California Style laws in states across the country creating the same problems that have been witnessed and documented by EIPCa-trained observers in California for years."

("EIPCa") is a California non-profit public benefit corporation committed to defending, through education, research, and advocacy the civil rights of U.S. citizens to fully participate in the election process under Federal and state law.

AUBURN HILLS, Mich., Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- 
- Wagoneer launching with powerful new Hurricane engine for 2023; continues to offer best-in-class towing capability
- Rooted in Jeep® brand heritage, Wagoneer marks the rebirth of a premium American icon, redefining "American premium" while delivering a unique customer experience
- Premium Wagoneer interior features up to 50 inches of total screen surface, available Amazon Fire TV Built-In and McIntosh audio system
- J.D. Power Best Residual Value Award comes on the heels of other prestigious honors

The premium, powerful Wagoneer is predicted to hold its value best among large SUVs, according to the J.D. Power 2023 U.S. ALG Residual Value Awards.
The U.S. ALG Residual Value Awards are the automotive industry standard in recognizing vehicle models projected to hold the highest percentage of their manufacturer's suggested retail price following a three-year period of ownership. This value retention is a key variable in the lease cost of a vehicle, underscoring an automaker's success in the areas of long-term quality and design, as well as the overall desirability of automotive brands and their models.
"Wagoneer is a breakthrough vehicle if ever there was one," said Jim Morrison, senior vice president and head of Jeep® brand North America. "The market was waiting for a product with its unique blend of prestige, capability and comfort. Like the original, Wagoneer has filled a significant void, and it's done so with genuine flair, demonstrating our commitment to redefining American premium and a unique customer experience."
Against this backdrop, the Wagoneer debuts for 2023 with a dynamic, new engine – the 420-horsepower Hurricane Twin Turbo I-6. The new engine, which comes as standard equipment in the Wagoneer Series II and Wagoneer Series III, generates peak torque of 468 lb.-ft.
Such capability enables Wagoneer to retain best-in-class towing honors of up to 10,000 pounds.
Other available features that distinguish the Wagoneer from its competitors are:
- Uconnect 5 connectivity
- Head-up display
- Up to 50 inches of total screen surface
- Amazon Fire TV Built-In
- McIntosh audio system

"Cutting-edge technology and refinement paired with Jeep heritage and capability places the Wagoneer atop the highly competitive large SUV segment for the 2023 Residual Value Awards," said Eric Lyman, Vice President ALG.
The Wagoneer's U.S. ALG Residual Value Award builds on recent honors, such as Luxury Vehicle of the Year by the Hispanic Motor Press, as well as Best Interior and Best New Features (for the Hurricane Twin Turbo) at the Texas Truck Rodeo.
Numerous variables affect the actual residual value of a vehicle over a multi-year lease term. Examples include mileage, quality/reliability, options and feature sets, weather and macroeconomic environment. Since these factors need to be taken into account in order to accurately forecast residual values, the more granularity and greater the understanding of the effect of each variable, the better equipped manufacturers and lenders are to be able to maximize profitability. The combination of J.D. Power insights and data with the deep experience of ALG in residual values allows for even more accurate end-of-lease forecasting capabilities.
Wagoneer
Wagoneer returns as a premium extension of the Jeep® brand while continuing its legacy as the original premium SUV. Building on a rich heritage of premium American craftsmanship while offering a new level of comfort, legendary 4x4 capability and customer service, Wagoneer forges a new path – one that defines the new standard of sophistication, authenticity and modern mobility. Offering a unique and premium customer service experience, Wagoneer delivers warm, capable, innovative and authentic vehicles with premium design cues and technology to a new, distinctive and successful array of customers. Combining these attributes with strong SUV credentials, the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer build on the original premium SUV by defining the next generation of an American icon. Stellantis offers a portfolio of brands and is a leading global automaker and mobility provider. For more information regarding Stellantis (NYSE: STLA), please visit www.stellantis.com.

Full text: Meridian, just 10 miles west of Boise, is home to the highly anticipated venue
DALLAS, Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- At long last, modern golf entertainment leader Topgolf will open its 83rd global venue on Monday, Nov. 28, in Meridian, Idaho, roughly 10 miles west of Boise. Located off Interstate 84 at Eagle View Landing development, the new venue will be the first to serve the state.
"The Boise community has let us know how excited they are to have a Topgolf opening near them, and we're just as excited to join the community," said Topgolf Chief Operating Officer Gen Gray. "Consider this an open invitation to Boise and beyond to come play around at Topgolf. Our whole experience is focused on just letting loose and having fun – no golf knowledge needed."
Think of Topgolf as a technology-enabled driving range, where Players aim for on-field targets from outdoor hitting bays (equipped with heaters!), while Topgolf's Toptracer technology tracks each ball's distance, height, speed and more in the same way you see during major golf tournaments on TV.

SSG George Perez and his family took ownership of the Fuquay-Varina home built and donated to honor his service in the U.S. Army
RALEIGH, N.C., Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - Operation: Coming Home and Mattamy Homes arranged for a flyover and a visit from active military personnel as part of a celebration that presented keys to U.S. Army Golden Knight SSG George Perez and his son for their donated new home.
At the 10 a.m. ceremony on November 10, the former U.S. Army 82 nd Airborne Division soldier took ownership of the custom-built Hero Home 26 in Mattamy's Providence Creek community in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina.
Previously, a September flag-raising ceremony honored the wounded veteran, who was seriously injured in Fallujah, Iraq during the Iraq War. An improvised explosive device (IED) encounter killed Perez' team member and left Perez with serious injuries requiring his left leg to be amputated below the knee joint.
Rather than retire from duty, Perez rejoined regular training as soon as he recovered enough to undertake the grueling regimen. He used his new prosthetic leg despite lingering, intense pain and regular, debilitating swelling. He rejoined the 82 nd Airborne Division in 2004 and eventually became the Army's first amputee to qualify for static line jumps.
"As a society, we owe injured armed service members like SSG Perez an enormous debt of gratitude," said Bob Wiggins, president of Mattamy Homes' Raleigh Division. "We are very pleased to present this home at no charge to a tireless and brave veteran who has paid so much on our behalf."
Many people spoke at the ceremony to recognize their appreciation for Perez. Key speakers included:
- Jim Burgin — North Carolina State Senator
- Howard Penny — North Carolina State Representative, District 53
- Lewis Weatherspoon — Chairman, Harnett County Board of Commissioners
- Bob Wiggins — Raleigh Division President, Mattamy Homes
- Paul Kane — Executive Vice President/CEO, Home Builders Association of Raleigh-Wake County
- David Price — President, Homebuilders Association of Raleigh Wake County
- Mike Elliott — President, The All Veteran Group

During the presentation of the keys, officials and neighbors gathered on the homesite adjacent to the Perez home, located in the Providence Creek community of Fuquay-Varina.
Mattamy and Operation: Coming Home arranged to surprise Perez and son with an unscheduled presentation. At a key moment, talented members of the 82 nd Airborne Division Chorus emerged from Perez' new garage to regale all attendees with an assortment of American Songbook classics and Carolina songs.
Donors had generously supplied the garage full of gifts (including a Craftsman tool set and work area) along with building materials, land, and labor. A Mattamy Homes team, alongside veterans and trade partners, helped lay sod, craft a custom 82 nd Airborne-themed butler's pantry and furnish several rooms in the home.
Mattamy selected the Perez homesite, while the family chose the design features. The homebuilder customized the Clearwater French Country ranch floorplan with accommodations for the veteran, including a study and a zero-entry owner's suite super shower with seat. Mattamy's open-concept floorplan will enhance Perez's everyday living and special gatherings with an attractive and free-flowing gourmet kitchen, dining area, Great Room and screened-in porch.
"We hope SSG Perez and his son enjoy their new home to the fullest," continued Bob Wiggins. "Mattamy Homes looks forward to partnering with Operation: Coming Home in honoring the next deserving veteran."
The honoree, SSG Perez, was very grateful for the home and for the community coming together for the ceremony. "I want to thank everybody who showed up and everybody that helped. Let's start a new chapter!"
The Perez home is the 11th home Mattamy has donated to Operation: Coming Home.

BURBANK, Calif., Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Nickelodeon and Spin Master are building on the global success of the award-winning top-rated preschool series, PAW Patrol , with the launch of Rubble & Crew , a brand-new animated spinoff centered around fan-favorite character Rubble on Friday, Feb. 3, at 11:30 a.m. (ET/PT). Produced by Spin Master Entertainment, Rubble & Crew (26 episodes) follows Rubble and his pup family as they use their awesome construction vehicles to build and repair whatever the town of Builder Cove needs in high-stakes adventures. The series marks the first television spinoff for preschool powerhouse PAW Patrol , which will celebrate its milestone 10 th anniversary in 2023. Rubble & Crew will air regularly Fridays at 11:30 a.m. (ET/PT) on Nickelodeon and continue to roll out on Nick Jr. channels internationally next year.  
"Every dog has its day, so we're answering the fan demand for more of PAW Patrol 's beloved bulldog, Rubble, with his very own series that marks the TV expansion of the global PAW franchise," said Ramsey Naito, President, Paramount Animation and Nickelodeon Animation. " Rubble & Crew is an all-new series focusing on family and community, and it's filled with new characters and big adventures that lean into construction play patterns that will let the audience engage in a whole new way."
"As a proud member of the PAW Patrol , Rubble has stolen the hearts of preschoolers around the world with his loyal, optimistic nature and penchant for treats," said Jennifer Dodge, Spin Master's President of Entertainment and Executive Producer. "Our new series expands Rubble's world with storytelling that digs into amazing construction projects and the importance of family, combined with high-stakes action, fun adventures and messy demolition that preschoolers will love."
Set in the community of Builder Cove, a neighboring town to PAW Patrol 's Adventure Bay, Rubble & Crew centers on Rubble, the funny and optimistic leader of the construction crew. In the small, quickly growing town, lots of things are still needed for the community to come together, including a bigger airport, train station, bridges, tunnels, schools, fire stations, parks and more. Rubble and his construction pup family--his pup cousins Mix, Wheeler, Charger, Motor, along with Grandpa Gravel and Auntie Crane--must work together to tackle and build all the projects the town needs.
Rubble & Crew will feature occasional appearances by familiar faces from Adventure Bay and introduce the following new characters:
- Mix, a construction chemist handling all things concrete, glue, cement and custom paints;
- Wheeler, the clean machine for this Builder Cove team, who does not like to get dirty and bolts away to clean up every mess;
- Charger, a big energy pup (especially when he gets a case of the zoomies!) who is kind and always eager to help out or dig into a new construction project;
- Motor, the tiniest and youngest pup who is a valuable member of the construction crew and looking for ways to be a good helper with her power smash-it energy;
- Grandpa Gravel, Rubble's grandpa, the family kibble chef who supplies the team with snacks from his tasty food truck;
- Auntie Crane, Rubble's auntie, who runs the supply warehouse and makes sure all the pups are loaded up and ready to build;
- Speed Meister, who runs the rival construction company in town along with his slow-moving villainous sidekick, Mr. McTurtle--together they build fast and sorta good;
- And Mayor Greatway, Adventure Bay Mayor Goodway's sister, a motorcycle-riding bubbly bundle of friendliness and her pet, Mr. Ducky-Doo.

Following the series launch of Rubble & Crew , PAW Patrol 's 10 th anniversary year in 2023 will culminate with the Oct. 13 release of the theatrical movie sequel, PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie , from Spin Master Entertainment, Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies. PAW Patrol was recently renewed for a 10 th season (26 episodes) that will follow the PAW-some pack of pups, including Chase, Marshall, Rubble, Skye, Rocky, Zuma, Everest and Tracker, on even more action-packed rescue missions and adventures--whether it's deep in the unexplored regions of the jungle or out-of-this-world trouble in Adventure Bay. Additionally, PAW Patrol 's Chase will take to the sky once again as a balloon in this year's 96 th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade ® .
Rubble & Crew is executive produced by Jennifer Dodge, Ronnen Harary, Laura Clunie, Toni Stevens and Bradley Zweig, and is directed by Dianna Basso and supervising director Joey So. Rubble & Crew was developed by Bradley Zweig based on the original PAW Patrol television series created by Keith Chapman. The series for Nickelodeon is overseen by Eryk Casemiro, Executive Vice President, Nickelodeon Animation, Global Series Content. Jen Pace serves as Nickelodeon's Production Executive for the series.

Speakers stress structural solutions can overcome problems, promote development
BEIJING, Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The advent of the digital era has established beyond any doubt the symbiotic relationship between science, technology and innovation on the one side and social and economic growth on the other — something that the key report delivered to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China highlighted, while urging more efforts toward Chinese modernization. To imbibe the spirit of that philosophy enshrined in the report, China Daily, in association with the University of Oxford, organized an online forum on Friday. The following special report encapsulates key insights on the theme shared by experts during the forum.
Technological innovation and the application of emerging digital technologies are playing an increasingly important role in promoting South-South cooperation, boosting the governance capacities of developing countries and creating greater synergy in their development, speakers said at an online forum on Friday.
Qu Yingpu, publisher and editor-in-chief of China Daily, highlighted that scientific innovation and the application of new technologies serve as a structural solution to the problems confronting the Global South in its development.
A report delivered to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China stressed the need to "regard science and technology as our primary productive force, talent as our primary resource and innovation as our primary driver of growth".
Noting that China attaches great importance to scientific and technological development and international cooperation, Qu said, "Over the past decade, the contribution of science and technology to China's economic growth has increased remarkably, which has paved a solid foundation for the country to advance Chinese modernization."
He also said the Chinese path to modernization provides an alternative way for countries to achieve rapid development while preserving their independence.
"China is committed to be a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of the international order. It is also a key participant of, and a contributor to, global development cooperation. From a global strategic perspective, stronger South-South cooperation will help promote democracy in international relations," Qu said.
Hosted by the China Watch Institute of China Daily and the Technology and Management Center for Development, which is part of the University of Oxford, the forum themed "South-South Cooperation in Science, Technology and Innovation" was held online on Friday.
Qu said the purpose of holding this forum is to share the experience of sustainable development and build consensus for promoting South-South cooperation, thus contributing to the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.
He called for efforts to enhance South-North cooperation and deepen South-South cooperation, and align the Global Development Initiative with the existing development and cooperation strategies of participating countries to generate greater synergy in global development.
Fu Xiaolan, fellow of the British Academy of Social Sciences, and professor and director of the Technology and Management Center for Development at the University of Oxford, said that innovation is an important driver of long-term economic growth and sustainable development, and emphasized the significance of international cooperation in science, technology and innovation.
"The rise of the innovation capabilities in the Global South, especially the emerging economies, has provided a very important addition and alternative for the other developing countries in terms of technology transfer and innovation collaboration," Fu said.
Fu further said that findings from a case study of Chinese tech heavyweight Tencent suggested the changes in the value of a firm from "managing people" to "serving people" play a very important role in motivating and empowering people for better innovation.
It is clear that digital technologies will transform lives and livelihoods by fundamentally and irrevocably changing how people, businesses and governments interact, said Sonia Bashir Kabir, vice co-chair of the Council of United Nations Technology Bank for Least Developed Countries.
She said the shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the weaknesses of existing systems, and countries with stronger digital infrastructure were able to mount faster, more effective responses.
With the blossoming of 5G, big data, artificial intelligence and other innovative digital technologies, the digital economy is gradually becoming the integral driving force for economic growth. According to a white paper released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, the scale of China's digital economy reached 45.5 trillion yuan ($6.39 trillion) in 2021, accounting for 39.8 percent of the country's GDP.
The countries of the South have contributed more than half of the world's growth in recent years. Intra-South trade is higher than ever, accounting for more than a quarter of all world trade, according to the United Nations.
Zhou Taidong, associate research fellow of the Development Research Center of the State Council, said digital technological innovation is injecting unprecedented momentum into the global economy and is propelling the economy and society toward a more intelligent and smarter era.
Zhou noted that strengthening cooperation in digital technology and intelligent science and technology among developing countries is becoming increasingly important and should be a key area of South-South cooperation in the future.
Zhou's views were echoed by Nobuya Haraguchi, chief of the Industrial Policy Research Unit at the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, who said advanced digital technologies are driving industrial growth across countries, and digitalization is also supporting industrial firms' resilience during the pandemic.
"The innovation of digital technologies and digital economy provide a vast space for international cooperation, especially among developing countries," said Cheng Hua, executive director of the Center for Digital Economy Research at the Renmin University of China in Beijing, adding promoting international cooperation through platform innovation requires good regulatory coordination among countries and clear regulations that are inclusive and prudent.

SALT LAKE CITY, Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Global law firm Greenberg Traurig, LLP has hired a group of 19 Intellectual Property (IP) & Technology Practice attorneys and patent agents, more than half of whom will be in the firm's Salt Lake City office, which first opened less than three years ago. The 31-person team, which includes specialist engineers and business staff, joined from FisherBroyles LLP.
New Shareholders Bryan K. Hanks and Jonathan R. Lee, both registered patent attorneys with electrical engineering backgrounds, will spend time in the firm's Salt Lake City and Phoenix offices. Eleven of the attorneys on the team will be based in Salt Lake City, nearly doubling the number of attorneys in that office.
"When we opened our doors in Salt Lake City, our focus was on offering clients the benefits of a law firm with a global reach. With the addition of this world-class patent team, the potential impact on what we can now offer clients in the IP space is incalculable," Greenberg Traurig Chief Executive Officer Brian L. Duffy said. "We've always grown our firm strategically which ensures we can handle work that is local, national, or international in scope. That is part of our commitment to our clients and to this community."
Hanks is a registered patent attorney focused on helping high-tech companies acquire and increase the value of intellectual assets. He is go-to counsel for pilot programs, strategic advice, and some of the most difficult legal and technical projects for enterprises ranging from startups to the largest corporations in the world. Hanks guides clients through many areas of patent law, including procurement, licensing, searches, freedom-to-operate opinions, and IP due diligence.
Lee is a registered patent attorney focused on the strategic development and enforcement of domestic and worldwide patent portfolios. As a trusted counselor to some of the largest and most recognizable companies in the world, he frequently counsels clients in a variety of IP-related areas, including litigation, opinions, and post-grant patent proceedings. Hanks and Lee have prepared and prosecuted thousands of domestic and foreign patent applications, primarily in the electrical and computer engineering fields.
"Jonathan and Bryan's team has a track record of success, serving the needs of clients in a variety of key technological industries," Greenberg Traurig Global IP & Technology Practice Co-Chairs Scott J. Bornstein and Mark R. Galis said in a joint statement. "Their backgrounds and experience elevate Greenberg Traurig's already strong resources in important technical areas and their collaborative nature will allow them to seamlessly integrate to take advantage of our substantial team of patent litigators and post-grant prosecutors."
Hanks and Lee's legal team includes five of counsels with technological backgrounds: Jon Bills, Allen Kim, Rebecca Kitz, Gregory R. Lunt, and Michael W. Russell. Bills, Kitz, and Lunt will be based in the Salt Lake City office; Kim will be based in the firm's Orange County, California, office, and Russell will divide his time between Albany, New York, and Washington, D.C.

They are committed to an expansive vision of building their IP practice and becoming the key players in top high-tech patent preparation and prosecution both in the region and throughout the country," Greenberg Traurig Salt Lake City office Co-Managing Shareholders Peggy Hunt and Annette W. Jarvis said.
"The Utah legal market – and especially the 'Silicon Slopes' area – is ripe for disruption. We're thrilled to join Greenberg Traurig and look forward to tapping into its global platform so we can expand services offered to existing clients nationwide," Hanks and Lee said in a joint statement. "One of the tenets of our legal practice is a commitment to diversity and inclusion, and Greenberg Traurig's integration of this belief into its culture is a major reason we joined the firm."
Hanks and Lee were some of the initial backers and participants in the Patent Pipeline Program, a partnership between Meta and the National Council on Patent Practicum. They are actively involved in the program, which aims to create more career opportunities for minorities and women in the patent profession; Jagadish and Singh are both alums of the program.

Full text: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Vision Films, Inc. ("Vision") announces the VOD release of the documentary Ghosts And The Afterlife from filmmaker Steve Sayre on December 13, 2022. Ghosts And The Afterlife was executive produced by Garrett Stewart Sayre, edited by Keven Albers, and directed by Steve Sayre.
Ghosts And The Afterlife is the definitive documentary on the subject of the afterlife based on all currently available scientific and historical evidence and has taken 12 years of in-depth research and investigation to complete. The feature-length film explores the paranormal and the relationship of life after life to science. Various religious and scientific perspectives are examined through interviews with some of the preeminent experts in their fields asserting that "death is not the end."
Watch the trailer: https://youtu.be/6FKGbixG3CE
Ghosts and the Afterlife is the first truly scientific investigation into ghosts and the hereafter. The film features James Van Praagh (creator and executive producer of "Ghost Whisperer"), Dr. Vernon Sylvest, M.D. (pathologist), Dr. Kenneth Rose (Harvard Ph.D. in philosophy and world religions), Psychics Eddie Conner, Justin Terry and Reverend F. Reed Brown, Dr. Jeffrey Rediger, M.D. (Harvard Professor and researcher into the phenomena of life-after-death experiences and spiritual healing), Dr. Norm Shealy, M.D., Ph.D., Raymond A. Moody Jr. (author of the best-selling book Life After Life) , Captain Frederick "Skip" Atwater (the Operations Officer in charge of the top-secret military Star Gate program that investigated consciousness beyond the physical mind) and many others.
The program is narrated on-camera by Kelsey Bohlen with special guest appearances by the late Emmy® award-winning Jay Thomas ( Murphy Brown, Cheers, Mr. Holland's Opus ); this was Thomas' last film project.
Lise Romanoff, Managing Director/CEO of Vision Films says, "This is a fascinating look at the consistently reported encounters people have experienced with near, after-death and ghost encounters throughout time. Whether one believes in ghosts or not, you will find the research and firsthand stories undeniably mesmerizing."
Director Steve Sayre, who has experienced two after-death experiences after suffering serious injury in the military, has this to say about the film's findings, "After having experienced life after death myself on two occasions, and considering the volumes of scientific and experiential evidence uncovered during the 12 years the film has been in production, there is no doubt that life continues after what we refer to as death."

BEIJING, Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Chinese President Xi Jinping wrapped up the 17th meeting of the G20 Leaders' Summit, the 29th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting and his official visit to Thailand on Saturday afternoon and left the country, returning to China, Chinese Central Television reported. The week-long trip, with a packed diplomatic schedule, offered Chinese wisdom and ideas for pushing forward globalization, setting the tone for the right direction for cooperation and coordination among major powers, experts said.
Xi said on Saturday during the 29th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Bangkok that free and open trade and investment form the purpose and principles of APEC and also the pillar for the realization of the Putrajaya Vision 2040.
Xi stressed the importance on upholding true multilateralism and defending the multilateral trading system. More should be done to safeguard the rules-based multilateral trading system, keep global industrial and supply chains secure and stable, foster an open, fair and non-discriminatory trade and investment environment, and strive for the early realization of a comprehensive, high-standard Free Trade Area in the Asia-Pacific, he said.
He also mentioned the importance of upholding inclusiveness for the benefit of all and upholding open regional cooperation for the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific. "China will not waver in its commitment to high-standard opening up. China will open its door still wider," Xi said.
The meeting issued the 2022 APEC Economic Leaders' Declaration and the Bangkok Goals on Bio-Circular-Green Economy.
The declaration, adopted after the two-day APEC gathering, affirmed APEC leaders' long-standing commitment to promote strong, balanced, secure, sustainable and inclusive growth, as well as their commitment to realize the APEC Putrajaya Vision.
Some Chinese observers believed that this year's APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting - the first in-person gathering since 2018 - was a milestone in building a community with a shared future for the Asia-Pacific, yielding some important results including the proposed free trade and investment structure, reaffirmed inclusiveness of regional growth and consensus of tackling the common challenges such as uneven development and the post-COVID recovery.
Free and open Asia-Pacific
"The Asia-Pacific region has become a driving force of the global growth, so that an open and free environment for investment and trade is extremely important, especially when there have been trends of decoupling and setting up barriers," Xu Liping, director of the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Saturday.
There are various multilateral and bilateral trade pacts in the region, and Xu stated that more efforts need to be made to integrate those free trade agreements to build a comprehensive free trade pact characterized by inclusiveness and mutual trust.
Intensive head-of-state diplomacy
In facing growing geopolitical challenges, China has pledged to promote peace and development, vowing to build a human community with a shared future, which was conveyed to the world at the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October and also fully underscored by Xi during his week-long trip to two major international gatherings in Southeast Asia.
As Xi's first foreign trip after the conclusion of the Party congress, Xi attended the G20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia, which was also an occasion for bilateral meetings with world leaders including US President Joe Biden. He met with many world leaders including those from US allies such as French President Emmanuel Macron and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in addition to leaders from emerging economies such as Argentina and South Africa.
During the APEC gathering, Xi also met leaders including Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Philippine President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos.

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Zion Christian Mission Center, a Bible education institution from Shincheonji, Church of Jesus, held its Class 113 graduation ceremony at Daegu Stadium on November 20. A total of 106,186 students graduated, making it the largest graduation of any theological institution in the world.
The number of people participating in the graduation ceremony in person in Korea was limited to 80,000 for safety reasons. But over 300,000 people worldwide participated in the ceremony online through the live broadcast in 9 languages.
The event consisted of an opening and closing ceremony, special performances, the awarding of certificates, and a commemorative speech by Shincheonji Church Chairman Lee Man-hee.
Among the graduates of Class 113, a total of 522 pastors — 37 domestic and 485 overseas — graduated. Offering the introductory, intermediate and advanced curriculum online via YouTube during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an increase in the number of pastors and seminary students who could participate. Two representatives of the graduates who shared their testimonies during the graduation were pastors.
"I only learned traditional theology at the seminary, but I didn't know much about the Book of Revelation. I taught words that were easy to preach to the saints and left out the difficult ones. I repent for I was a sinner who added and took away from God's word," said Mr. Heo Jeong Wook, a second-generation minister who presented his testimony at the graduation ceremony.
Mr. Wook added, "I put down everything that I had and I came out to the truth. I am graduating after learning the true theology that leads to heaven and not the teachings of man. I thank God who has given me this chance of life."
The representative of the overseas graduates was Mr. D. Jackson, a priest in India. After taking an online Bible class with Shincheonji Church of Jesus in October 2021, he signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) and changed the name of the seminary he was operating to Hepto Zion Christian Mission Center. Currently, 294 members, including pastors in charge of two churches belonging to the denomination, completed all courses at the Zion Christian Mission Center and graduated.
In 2019, the mission center graduated 103,764 students. Despite the pandemic, about 20,000 students graduated in 2020 and in 2021.

Full text: MORRISVILLE, N.C., Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Immorna, a rapidly expanding biotechnology company, focusing on the development of multi-platform RNA-based therapeutics and vaccines, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared its investigational new drug (IND) application to conduct a Phase 1/2 multi-center study of JCXH-221, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) complexed broadly protective mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection and diseases. The goal of this multi-center study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of JCXH-221 in healthy adult subjects.
"We are excited to receive our second US IND clearance this year for our innovative RNA-based pipeline asset, and further strengthen our portfolio," said NgocDiep Le, M.D., Ph.D., Global Chief Medical Officer of Immorna. "Vaccination remains a key component of the complex approach required to reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and diseases. The continued emergence of new variants, the waning of the immune response after vaccination, and the limited availability of currently approved vaccines in lower-income countries, necessitate the development of new COVID-19 vaccine candidates with broadly protective potential and ready availability for rapid pandemic response. We strongly believe that JCXH-221 is an excellent vaccine candidate to address this unmet medical need."
JCXH-221 is a mono-valent yet broadly protective mRNA-LNP vaccine. Once administered, the single chain mRNA will translate and be spontaneously assembled into multimers that contain immune epitopes from several SARS-CoV-2 strains. The multimer configuration is believed to further enhance their immunogenicity. In preclinical testing, JCXH-221 elicited robust neutralizing antibodies against an assay of viral strains, including the ancestral, Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4/5. JCXH-221 is formulated with a thermal stable nanoparticle delivery system that is stable at 2-8°C for at least 18 months.
Zihao Wang, Ph.D., Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Immorna added, "The COVID-19 virus will likely remain a challenge for the foreseeable future and continue to evolve. New variants may be able to evade the protective immunity that individuals have established from prior infection or immunization. A resurgence of the past, more lethal, variants could also have a devastating effect on those whose immunity has waned. Therefore, we believe developing a broadly protective (ideally universal) COVID-19 vaccine is critically important to keep this virus under control. Additionally, lessening the ultra-low temperature storage and transportation requirements could enable a more affordable and accessible vaccine option worldwide. We believe the combined features of JCXH-221 could address these needs and make it well positioned to become a next generation vaccine against this evolving pandemic."
The Phase 1 part of this study will be a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, immunogenicity, and determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for JCXH-221. The Phase 2 part will be a randomized, double-blinded, active-controlled study to further characterize the safety and immunogenicity of JCXH-221 at the RP2D.

Full text: SHANGHAI, Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Yum China Holdings, Inc. (the "Company" or "Yum China", NYSE: YUMC and HKEX: 9987) today announced that the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has approved the Company's near-term science-based emissions reduction target, making the Company the first restaurant company in China to reach this milestone.
Yum China has pledged to align its business with the most ambitious aim of the Paris Agreement, to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and reach net-zero by 2050. Approval of the near-term science-based targets (SBTs) marks a significant milestone of the Company's journey towards net-zero value chain GHG emissions by 2050. 
The approved near-term targets are：
- Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 63% by 2035 from a 2020 base year.
- Reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods 66.3% per ton of goods purchased by 2035 from a 2020 base year.

To drive progress, Yum China has also developed a 1.5°C-aligned decarbonization strategy and roadmap, focusing on energy efficiency improvement, renewable energy investment, and supplier engagement.
"Climate action tops the list of our sustainability priorities. The goals we set are truly ambitious and will require a lot of work and collaboration with stakeholders across the value chain," said Joey Wat, CEO of Yum China. "However, we believe this is the right thing to do. While we will carefully evaluate our options for reaching our targets, we believe our efforts will support the delivery of long-term sustainable value for our customers, our shareholders, and our communities."
Yum China will continue to enhance transparency in communicating its climate action, through the Company's Annual Sustainability Report, TCFD Report (Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures) and CDP Questionnaires.

Full text: Adds significant clinical, translational science and immunology expertise to leadership team as Quell prepares to advance QEL-001 into its first clinical trial and progresses its CAR-Treg cell therapy pipeline programs in Auto-Immunity and Neuro-Inflammation
LONDON, Nov. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Quell Therapeutics Ltd ("Quell"), a world leader in developing engineered T-regulatory (Treg) cell therapies for serious medical conditions driven by the immune system, announces the appointment of Luke Devey, BMBCh, Ph.D. as Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Devey brings to Quell significant translational science and immunology expertise from Senior Executive roles at leading pharmaceutical companies, in addition to over 15 years of clinical experience.
Dr. Devey joins Quell from Janssen Immunology where he was Vice President and Head of Translational Science. In this role, he led integration of new translational approaches across Janssen's end-to-end immunology pipeline. Prior to Janssen, Dr. Devey held the position of Head of Early Discovery Biology, Immunology & Inflammation at Celgene, and Senior roles in Experimental Medicine at GSK.
Dr. Devey holds a Bachelor of Medicine and a Bachelor of Surgery (BMBCh) from the University of Oxford and gained his Ph.D. from the University of Birmingham, UK in the area of liver transplantation. He is a Visiting Professor of Immunology, Nuffield Department of Medicine at the University of Oxford.
"I am delighted to welcome Luke to the team at Quell at a pivotal time for the organization," said Iain McGill, Chief Executive Officer of Quell Therapeutics. "His extensive drug development experience in immunology and his proven clinical development and translational science capabilities will be a significant asset as we advance QEL-001 into its first-in-human Phase 1/2 trial – the 'LIBERATE' trial – and progress our pipeline of novel Treg cell therapies through preclinical development."
Luke Devey added: "Quell Therapeutics is pioneering an exciting Treg cell therapy approach to treating diseases driven by immune dysregulation. The Company's application of cutting-edge technologies and translational approaches to inform and execute its development strategy resonates very strongly with me. In QEL-001, which is poised to enter its first clinical study, Quell has a potentially transformational Treg cell therapy to prevent organ rejection in liver transplant patients, which will constitute one of the most significant advances in the field for decades, and which will provide extensive translational data to refine the CAR-Treg platform for other indications. I am truly excited to play a part in driving this pioneering program and to contribute to the progression of Quell's Treg cell therapy pipeline."
About Quell Therapeutics
Quell Therapeutics is a world leader in developing engineered T-regulatory (Treg) cell therapies that aim to harness, direct and optimize their immune suppressive properties to address serious medical conditions driven by the immune system.
The Company is leveraging its pioneering phenotype lock technology, unique multi-modular platform and integrated manufacturing capabilities to design and develop a pipeline of highly engineered Treg cell therapies with greater potential for persistence, potency and stability than earlier generations of Treg cell therapy approaches.
Quell's lead candidate QEL-001 is being developed to induce operational tolerance following liver transplantation, with the potential to protect the post-transplant liver without the need for chronic immunosuppressive medications. Quell is also advancing additional programs in neuro-inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. www.quell-tx.com.

SINGAPORE, Nov. 20, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- RVAC Medicines Pte. Ltd. (RVAC), a messenger RNA (mRNA) technology platform company incubated by CBC Group, a healthcare-dedicated asset management firm headquartered in Singapore, and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) today announced the signing of a master research collaboration agreement to jointly study and develop solutions to build mRNA manufacturing and analytics capabilities in Singapore.
With this collaboration, RVAC and A*STAR will set up a joint laboratory based at A*STAR's Bioprocessing Technology Institute (BTI) to develop a preclinical manufacturing platform, which will facilitate the generation of novel raw materials and potentially clinical-grade assets for the development of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics targeting infectious diseases and other conditions with unmet needs.
Leveraging BTI's deep expertise in processing technologies and analytical sciences for biotherapeutics and the strong translational research in biomedical technologies across multiple research institutes in A*STAR, this collaboration seeks to enable local ecosystem innovators and global manufacturers to access the manufacturing platform to aid in preclinical asset development.
The collaboration utilizes RVAC's extensive capabilities in mRNA, vaccine, and drug delivery technologies, as well as knowledge and expertise in biopharmaceutical manufacturing, research and development (R&D), clinical development, and commercialization. RVAC develops mRNA-based vaccines targeting infectious diseases such as COVID-19, for which it initiated a first-in-human vaccine clinical trial in September 2022. Additional RVAC pipeline assets in development include vaccines targeting respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Clostridioides difficile (CDI) infections. Since its founding in June 2021, RVAC has recruited a team of more than 80 top-tier scientists and experienced industry veterans, and has established R&D centres in Boston, MA, USA and Shanghai, PRC.
"Our collaboration with A*STAR brings together innovative research and development experience from some of the world's leading mRNA researchers," said Dr Sean Fu, Chief Executive Officer of RVAC. "We are committed to providing the staff, equipment, and technological expertise, with support from our R&D teams around the world, to this endeavour. Combined with A*STAR's knowledge and experience, this partnership has the potential to continue the advancement of mRNA as a new class of medicines."
Professor Ng Huck Hui, Assistant Chief Executive, Biomedical Research Council, A*STAR, said, "Public-private partnerships are key enablers in translating science into impact. A*STAR's multidisciplinary R&D capabilities in infectious diseases, artificial intelligence, analytics and protein engineering, coupled with RVAC's expertise, will advance the development of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics and contribute to better health outcomes for Singapore and beyond."
Fu Wei, Chief Executive Officer, CBC Group added, "The collaboration between RVAC and A*STAR is a significant step in supporting the growth of innovative R&D that will ultimately drive the development of advanced vaccines and therapeutics to benefit more patients. This is aligned with CBC's mission of delivering quality and accessible medical innovation across Asia and beyond. The collaboration will also enhance the technological capability of our ecosystem, which fits well with Singapore's commitment to mission-oriented and curiosity-driven R&D."

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 20, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --
WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds investors who: (a) exchanged Discovery, Inc. ("Discovery") common stock (NASDAQ: DISCA, DISCB, DISCK) for Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. ("Warner Bros.") common stock (NASDAQ: WBD) pursuant to Discovery's February 4, 2022 Registration Statement on Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 10, 2022; and/or (b) acquired Warner  Bros. common stock pursuant or traceable to the Registration Statement and Prospectus, including shareholders of AT&T Inc. ("AT&T") and/or Magallanes, Inc, a Delaware corporation ("Spinco") who acquired Warner Bros. common stock as a result of the merger (the "Merger") between Discovery and Spinco; and/or (c) purchased shares of Warner Bros. common stock on the open market traceable to the Prospectus through the date of the filing of the complaint on September 23, 2022 of the important November 22, 2022   lead plaintiff deadline .
SO WHAT:  If you exchanged Discovery common stock for Warner Bros. common stock pursuant to Discovery's February 4, 2022 Registration Statement on Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus filed with the SEC on February 10, 2022 and/or acquired Warner Bros. common stock pursuant or traceable to the Registration Statement and Prospectus, including shareholders of AT&T and/or Magallanes, Inc, a Delaware corporation ("Spinco") and/or purchased shares of Warner Bros. common stock on the open market traceable to the Prospectus through September 23, 2022, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.
WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Warner Bros. Discovery class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=8888 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than November 22, 2022 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, at the time of filing the Registration Statement and Prospectus, defendants either knew or had access to adverse information concerning operations of the WarnerMedia business of AT&T. Among other things, as subsequently disclosed by defendants after the merger: (1) WarnerMedia's HBO Max streaming business had a high churn rate that made the business not "viable" unless the churn rate was reversed; (2) AT&T was overinvesting in WarnerMedia entertainment content for streaming, without sufficient concern for return on investments; (3) WarnerMedia had a business model to grow the number of subscribers to its streaming service without regard to cost or profitability; (4) WarnerMedia was improvidently concentrating its investments in streaming and ignoring its other business lines; and (5) WarnerMedia had overstated the number of subscribers to HBO Max by as many as 10 million subscribers, by including as subscribers AT&T customers who had received bundled access to HBO Max, but had not signed onto the service. The adverse information was not disclosed to Discovery shareholders in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or otherwise prior to the effective date of the merger. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
To join the Warner Bros. Discovery class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=8888 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.
No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Full text: NEW YORK, Nov. 20, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --
WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) between August 1, 2019 and July 28, 2022, both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"), of the important December 27, 2022   lead plaintiff deadline .
SO WHAT:  If you purchased U.S. Bancorp securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.
WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the U.S. Bancorp class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=9420 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than December 27, 2022 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bancorp's banking subsidiary) created sales pressure on its employees that led them to open credit cards, lines of credit, and deposit accounts without consumers' knowledge and consent; (2) since at least 2015, U.S. Bank National Association and by extension, U.S. Bancorp, was aware of such unauthorized conduct that it was violating relevant regulations and laws aimed at protecting its consumers; (3) U.S. Bancorp failed to properly monitor its employees from engaging in such unlawful conduct, detect and stop the misconduct, and identify and remediate harmed consumers; (4) all the foregoing subjected the Company to a foreseeable risk of heightened regulatory scrutiny or investigation; (5) U.S. Bancorp's revenues were in part the product of unlawful conduct and thus unsustainable; and (6) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
To join the U.S. Bancorp class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=9420 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.
No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Full text: World Children's Day Statement by Education Cannot Wait Director Yasmine Sherif
NEW YORK, Nov. 20, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- On World Children's Day, we must remember what it means to be a child born with a right to reach the human potential. Nothing is more precious, more priceless, than a child growing towards that potential. And nothing is more despicable than to ignore the innocence and learning needs of a child in the process of becoming…
The child's brain is in constant flux and growth and can move in either direction. The education the child receives from day one onwards – the mind, the heart and the soul – will determine the outcome and prospects for achieving the human potential. Sadly, it would take thousands of years until we finally declared – six decades ago – the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. Now, we must realize it.
Children have a right to early childhood development and a right to attend formal school. This is our promise to them as we bring them into the world. Because without them how can we possibly create a better world? Not only are they our world, they are our hope for a better world. They are our promise in materializing all human rights and in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.
Through early learning and childhood development we prepare them for formal education and for life, itself. By encouraging our daughters, we empower them to become strong girls and young women who will lead the way through the 21st century, so that we can bring an end to the era where women were hidden in the dark.
By allowing our children to rebel, explore and develop their curiosity for learning and knowledge, and by matching that with a quality education, we prepare them to become climate activists who will protect both people and planet, teachers who will kindle a light in their students, nurses and doctors who will save lives, human rights activists who will speak truth to power, scientists and entrepreneurs who will keep our drive for creativity and innovation on fire, and government officials who will lead by ethical imperatives and democratic values.
This is what we promised six decades ago in adopting the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. How can we justify six decades later that we have not yet invested in all of them through a quality education – but instead left millions of them to fend for themselves against sexual violence and rape, child marriage, child labor, extreme poverty, illiteracy, recruitment into armed groups, and other violations against children.
Investing in their education is our investment in resilient economies, strong and peaceful communities and is the most profitable investment in a more just and humane world for generations to come.
Now is our time to act for children everywhere. Now is our time to deliver on our promises of an education, especially for the 222 million girls and boys whose education has been brutally disrupted by armed conflicts, forced displacement, climate-induced disasters and protracted crises. Each one has a dream: #222MillionDreams. Each one has a potential and a story to tell. We need their voices to be heard and their dreams to be realized, now more than ever.
The Government of Switzerland and Education Cannot Wait will host ECW's High-Level Financing Conference on 16-17 February 2023 in Geneva. Co-convened by the Governments of Colombia, Germany, Niger, Norway and South Sudan, the conference will provide global leaders, and public and private sector donors with the opportunity to substantively fund ECW to help ensure every child, everywhere, is able to go to school – especially the 222 million crisis-impacted children and adolescents caught in the world's toughest contexts who urgently need education support.  
As the United Nations global fund for education in emergencies and protracted crises, ECW is working to deliver on their 222 million dreams. Our Case for Investment and our 2023-2026 Strategic Plan outline our important contribution to these global commitments.
Children are both the present and the future. They must be heard and they must be seen. Their rights must be honored and their potentials realized. They must be put front and center in our global agenda for sustainable development and our global promise to ensure universal human rights, peace and security. The time has come to invest in education as the very foundation for every child and hence the pillar upon which we build the world we want.
Donate today and join ECW's #222MillionDreams campaign – because #EducationCannotWait for any child. Also available in Spanish, French and Arabic.

FansMall will release the Argentina National Team cards alongside the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 
SHANGHAI, Nov. 20, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The opening of the quadrennial global event is approaching, with the 2022 World Cup in Qatar set to begin in late November, after 20 years of rekindling the flame in Asia. It will be the first time in the history of a World Cup being held in early winter, it's also the last dance for Lionel Messi and other stars born in the mid-80s to perform on the premier stage.
FansMall, the full industry chain trading cards platform, which has been exclusively authorized by the Argentine national team, recently previewed that it will launch exclusive Argentine national team trading cards during the Qatar World Cup, presenting valuable blue and white collectibles to all fans.
Go for the same goal. We celebrate the event with the Blue and White. 32 teams assembled, the pinnacle is approaching, and the world is waiting for the World Cup in Qatar. Argentina, a South American powerhouse, left countless thrilling moments in World Cup history. Now, fans are also eagerly awaiting this one of the favourites to win. The team's top star, 35-year-old Lionel Messi, will embark on his fifth World Cup campaign, and this will be his last trip to compete in this top event.
As Lionel Messi's curtain call is highly anticipated, FansMall and fans are looking forward to the Pampas Eagles soaring on the green once again. In July this year, FansMall reached a five-year strategic partnership with the Argentine Football Association (AFA) to launch the exclusive Argentina trading cards in Asia. The creativity and technical of Argentine football, the indomitable spirit of the Pampas Eagles, and Lionel Messi as the soul of his team, all coincide with FansMall's corporate ethos, two spirits resonate with the same frequency and finally come to the same side.
China debut, FansMall up against the global giants. To be associated with one of the most prestigious national football teams and to be granted the exclusive official IP license in Asia, FansMall is in the leading position in the sports trading cards industry, especially within Asia. It is clear that FansMall, the first company in China to manufacture trading cards for the world's top men's national football team, is strong enough to stand on the world stage and compete head-to-head with industry leaders like Panini.
The partnership with the Argentine national team will not only draw the world's attention to the booming development and great potential of China's football trading cards industry but will also be a golden opportunity for the popularisation and cultivation of Chinese football trading cards culture. Although the Chinese trading cards market started late, the consumer's willingness to pay is growing as the domestic sports industry is developing. It is believed that in the heated atmosphere of the World Cup in Qatar, the consumers will be more engaged.
It is reported that in conjunction with the 2022 Qatar World Cup, FansMall will officially launch 4 sets of Argentina national team trading cards, naming ICE-BREAKING, MOMENT, COSMOS and ONENESS. Each set has distinctive characteristics, combining Argentine football elements and Chinese-inspired design, bringing enjoyment and surprise to all football trading cards fans, collectors and investors, so stay tuned.

Full text: This webinar will cover the policy changes that led to the regulation of articles, EPA's authority to regulate these articles, and what companies need to know to stay in compliance.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 19, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- When the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) was enacted in 1976, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) focused its attention on chemical substances and chemical mixtures, while largely exempting the regulation of chemicals in "articles," generally meaning finished products or manufactured goods. EPA's more recent announcement of its intent to regulate chemicals in articles to a much greater extent has caught many in the regulated industries off guard and reflects a significant shift in U.S. chemical regulation policy. This change in policy affects all commercial entities that deal with a physical product, as they must now become familiar with the law, its requirements, and the chemical makeup of their finished goods. This webinar will cover the policy changes that led to the regulation of articles, EPA's authority to regulate these articles, and what companies need to know to stay in compliance.
Register now to join Richard E. Engler, Ph.D., Eve Gartner, and Lynn L. Bergeson for the Bergeson & Campbell, P.C. (B&C®) webinar "Articles under TSCA" from 12:00 p.m. - 1:00 p.m. (EST) on December 7, 2022.
Topics Covered:
- What products in commerce qualify as articles;
- What EPA's change in approach means as a practical matter for the supply chain; and
- The importance and challenges of transparency in product sourcing.

Speakers Include:
Richard E. Engler, Ph.D. is Director of Chemistry with B&C. Dr. Engler is a 17-year veteran of EPA and is one of the most widely recognized experts in the field of green chemistry, having served as senior staff scientist in EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) and leader of EPA's Green Chemistry Program. He has participated in thousands of TSCA substance reviews at EPA, as well as pre-notice and post-review meetings with submitters to resolve complex or difficult cases, and he draws upon this invaluable experience to assist B&C clients as they develop and commercialize novel chemistries.
Eve Gartner is the Managing Attorney for the Toxic Exposure and Health Program at Earthjustice, where she leads a team of professionals charged with protecting human health from toxic chemicals. Ms. Gartner works with groups around the country to develop state policies that will reduce exposures to chemicals and pesticides. She also serves as part of Project TENDR, a collaboration of scientists, health professionals, and children's health advocates working to develop policy approaches to address the link between environmental exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders.
Lynn L. Bergeson, Managing Partner, B&C, has earned an international reputation for her deep and expansive understanding of how regulatory programs pertain to nanotechnology, industrial biotechnology, synthetic biology, and other emerging transformative technologies. Ms. Bergeson counsels corporations, trade associations, and business consortia on a wide range of issues pertaining to chemical hazard, exposure and risk assessment, risk communication, minimizing legal liability, and evolving regulatory and policy matters.

Full text: NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- ClaimsFiler, a FREE shareholder information service, reminds investors that they have until December 5, 2022 to file lead plaintiff applications in a securities class action lawsuit against PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NasdaqGS: PYPL), if they purchased the Company's shares between February 3, 2021 and February 1, 2022, inclusive (the "Class Period"). This action is pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.
Get Help PayPal investors should visit us at https://claimsfiler.com/cases/nasdaq-pypl-3/ or call toll-free (844) 367-9658. Lawyers at Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC are available to discuss your legal options.
About the Lawsuit PayPal and certain of its executives are charged with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws. 
On February 1, 2022, the Company disclosed that its net new active accounts figure ("NNAs") was only 49 million for 2021, less than the guidance of 50 million it initially provided in February 2021 and lower than the raised guidance it reiterated just months prior, that it had identified 4.5 million accounts believed to have been illegitimately created, and that, as a result, it would change focus to increasing active user engagement rather than cash account opening incentives, which would reduce its ability to maintain growth in its NNAs.
On this news, shares of PayPal plummeted $43.23 per share, or approximately 25%, from a close of $175.80 per share on February 1, 2022 to close at $132.57 per share on February 2, 2022.
The case is Defined Benefit Plan of the Mid-Jersey Trucking Industry and Teamsters Local 701 Pension and Annuity Fund v. PayPal Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 22-cv-05864.

Full text: ST. LOUIS, Nov. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Wholly‐owned subsidiaries of Peabody (NYSE: BTU), PIC AU Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " Main Issuer "), and PIC AU Holdings Corporation, a Delaware corporation (together with the Main Issuer, the " Co‐Issuers "), today announced the expiration and final results of their previously announced offer to purchase (the " Notes Offer ") for cash up to $81.6 million (the " Offer Amount ") in aggregate principal amount of their 10.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the " Notes ") at a purchase price equal to 105.91% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest as set forth in the Indenture (as defined below), to, but excluding, the settlement date, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated September 19, 2022 (as amended by the press release issued on October 27, 2022, the " Offer to Purchase ").
The Notes Offer expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 18, 2022 (the " Expiration Time "). As of the Expiration Time, $53,445,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Notes had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Time.
Subject to the Offer Amount as further described below, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) prior to the Expiration Time and accepted by the Co-Issuers, holders of Notes will receive $1,059.10 in cash (the " Offer Price "), plus accrued and unpaid interest as set forth in the Indenture, to, but excluding, the settlement date.
Payment for such accepted Notes will be made on November 22, 2022. After giving effect to the purchase of the tendered and accepted Notes, approximately $28,105,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Notes will remain outstanding.
The Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of January 29, 2021, by and among the Co-Issuers, Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee and Peabody (on a limited basis, to the extent of its obligations specifically set forth in the Indenture) (as amended and restated by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 3, 2021, and as further amended, supplemented, restated or otherwise modified to the date hereof, the " Indenture "). Under the terms of the Indenture, no later than 30 days following any voluntary prepayment, repayment or repurchase of term loans, the Co‐Issuers are obligated to offer to purchase for cash an aggregate principal amount of up to term loans so prepaid, repaid or repurchased. On September 14, 2022, the Co-Issuers repurchased $20.4 million aggregate principal amount of their 10.000% senior secured term loan due 2024 (the " Term Loan ") at a weighted average purchase price of 105.91% of par, in accordance with the Credit Agreement, dated as of January 29, 2021, among the Co-Issuers, as co-borrowers, the lenders party thereto from time to time and Wilmington Trust, National Association (as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), as administrative agent, which governs the Term Loans. As such, the Notes Offer was intended to satisfy the requirements of the Indenture.
In addition to the Notes Offer, the Co-Issuers simultaneously made a separate offer to purchase an aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan not to exceed the lesser of (x) $61,194,954.99, and (y) (i) the aggregate principal amount of Notes actually repurchased in the Notes Offer, less (ii) $20,355,045.01, at a purchase price of 105.91% of par (the " Term Loan Offer ").  The Term Loan Offer was subsequently increased on November 8, 2022 to an amount equal to the full $114,613,206.92 aggregate principal amount of Term Loan outstanding.  As of the Expiration Time, approximately $111,669,083.13 of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn.  After giving effect to the purchase of the tendered and accepted Term Loan, approximately $2,944,123.79 in aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan will remain outstanding. The Term Loan Offer to the lenders under the Term Loan was not contingent on the separate Notes Offer.
This announcement is not an offer to purchase or sell, or a solicitation of an offer to purchase or sell any securities in any jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the securities, blue sky or other laws of such jurisdiction.

Organizations will rely on IT for ESG execution, and IT leaders will need to be ready for it
TORONTO, Nov. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - With environmental, social, and governance (ESG) becoming an ongoing corporate imperative, global IT research and advisory firm Info-Tech Research Group has released its timely research-backed blueprint titled  The ESG Imperative and Its Impact on Organizations . The firm's research indicates that IT will likely play a critical role in achieving ESG goals, but to do so successfully will also require clarification of IT's role in the process.
The new industry resource was created to help IT leaders better understand ESG factors and the broader concept of sustainability. It will also help identify changes that may be needed in the organizational operating model, as well as discover areas of IT that may need to be prioritized and resourced.
Info-Tech's findings show that a major challenge for organizations in their ESG program journey is the constantly evolving and inconsistent regulatory requirements for climate disclosure. Other challenges can be attributed to the difficulty of communicating long-term value within an organization when customer and employee expectations shift, or collecting data from across the functional business, geographical locations, supplier base, and supply chains while trying to meet ESG objectives.
The top impacts of ESG on IT departments identified by Info-Tech's blueprint include the following:
- ESG requires corporations to keep track of ESG-related risks of third parties. This will mean more robust assessments and monitoring.
- Many areas of ESG are new and will require new processes and tools.
- The SEC has upped the ante recently, requiring more rigorous accountability and reporting on cyber incidents.
- New IT systems and architecture may be needed to support ESG programs.
- Current reporting frameworks may need updating as regulators move to digital.
- Ethical design will need to be considered when AI is used to support risk/data management and when it is used as part of product solutions.
The research suggests that an organization's approach to ESG cannot be static or tactical, as ESG is a moving landscape that requires a flexible, holistic approach across the organization. Instead, the process must become part of the way IT fundamentally works to enable an active response to changing conditions.
"Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) is a corporate imperative that is tied to long-term value creation. An organization's social license to operate and future corporate performance depends on managing ESG factors well," says Donna Bales, principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group. "Central to an ESG program is having a good understanding of the ESG factors that may have a material impact on enterprise value and key internal and external stakeholders. A comprehensive ESG strategy supported by strong governance and risk management is essential to success."
The firm's blueprint highlights that organizations should be knowledgeable about ESG factors and the broader concept of sustainability to overcome the challenges.  This can be accomplished through an ESG program journey. When embarking on an ESG program journey, IT leaders must consider the following:
- Understand the ESG Drivers – This includes an understanding of the visibility of climate change, regulatory requirements, rise in ESG investing, and a younger generation with strong convictions and financial influence.
- Set the Program Purpose – Leaders need to clarify ESG goals and intentions with respect to the organization while considering the role of the corporation in society and its impact on key stakeholders.
- Assess the Material Impact of ESG Factors on the Business – It is important for IT leaders to survey key stakeholders to obtain a more holistic viewpoint of expectations and the industry landscape in order to anticipate how stakeholders will react to emerging issues. When done correctly, this will lead to increased credibility and trust.
- Weigh Risks, Opportunities, and Financial Impact – Leaders are responsible for weighing options and adjusting the business operating model to align with ESG goals.
- Approach and Governance – Effective governance is essential to instill trust, support sound decision making, and manage ESG. The organizational approach to ESG will differ across industry segments and corporations depending on material risks and their upstream and downstream value change.
- Identify Gaps Against Desired Outcomes – Like any journey, the ESG journey requires assessing the start point of the organization and defining the end goal. Using the results of the materiality assessment, leaders must weigh the risk, opportunities, and financial impact to help prioritize and determine vulnerabilities.
- Deliver on Goals and Disclosure – Organizations will rely on IT for execution, and IT leaders will need to be prepared and supported to accomplish successful implementation.
- Continually Report and Measure – Metrics are key to telling an organization's ESG story, so leaders must place the appropriate importance on the information that will be reported.

IT groups can help organizations develop strategic plans to meet ESG goals, measure performance, monitor risks, and deliver on disclosure requirements. This aid can extend from the CIO providing input at a strategic level to leading the charge within IT to instill new goals and adapt the culture toward one focused on sustainability. However, to set the tone, CIOs should begin by updating their IT governance structure and setting ESG goals for their IT teams. In addition, IT leaders must consider resource use and efficiency and incorporate this into their IT strategy as they move forward.
Info-Tech research highlights that ESG has moved beyond the tipping point to corporate table stakes and that IT plays a critical role in achieving ESG goals. IT leaders need to work collaboratively with risk management to optimize decision making and continually improve ESG performance and disclosure.
"For many organizations, the ESG program journey has just begun, and collaboration between IT and risk, procurement, and compliance will be critical in shaping program success," adds Bales.

Full text: Kellogg Company, Media.Hotline@kellogg.com, 269-961-3799
BATTLE CREEK, Mich., Nov. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Globally, both the public and private sectors are working together to achieve United Nations Sustainable Development Goal No. 2 – ending hunger, achieving food security, and improving well-being and sustainable agriculture by 2030. Dr. Nigel Hughes, SVP Global Innovation and R&D, Kellogg Company & Dr. Pam Henderson, CEO of NewEdge, Inc., share strategies on how innovation and R&D teams can transform our global food system in a new blog post.
Social K: Kellogg Company Blog
The world's population is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, and with it will come an increased demand for food. The United Nations estimates that the world will need to produce 60% more food by 2050 to keep up with population growth. However, doing that within the boundaries of what our planet can sustainably grow presents an existential challenge.
Driving the efficiency of our current food production practices isn't the answer. The agri-food industry is responsible for around 25% of greenhouse gas emissions and 70% of freshwater consumption and is significantly over-reliant on animal foods.
To sustainably feed the world's growing population, we must embrace the next agricultural revolution and find new ways to innovate our food system.
Sustainable Food as an Innovation Opportunity
The food system's impact on climate change and biodiversity is just beginning to receive the recognition it deserves and needs. We all must think differently to improve it, working with nature rather than exploiting it. For food companies, this can't simply be delegated to a sustainability department. These are significant challenges but equally attractive and exciting innovation problems to solve. At its very heart, impacting the food system is an innovation opportunity.
When we apply Opportunity Thinking®, we combine a view of the needs in the market, the value propositions that can be created through technology and business models, and the conditions and trends that bring these together, and we can begin to unlock solutions. The food system is a significant opportunity: the need is profound, the value proposition of food security and independence is worth working towards, and the conditions of climate change and water scarcity are prime for transformational innovation.
Sustainable Food as an opportunity for Experimentation
Building the right value webs throughout the system is essential to drive meaningful change. Today's system is complex, and there is a myriad of stakeholders with vested interest in its success. The challenge has been addressed by convening large ecosystems of influencers, observers, and participants, but the result is often more discussion than action. While we must work together and leverage one another's strengths and roles, too many "cooks in the kitchen" will hinder innovation and keep us from scaling sustainable foods globally.
Changes to large-scale food systems require innovation teams to be at their best, experimenting with new approaches in closed systems that provide controlled environments before scaling those solutions. 
A great example of a closed loop experiment is vertical farming in the UAE, allowing year-round production without using fertilizers and pesticides at a smaller footprint than traditional farming. Being in cities close to where people will live, it's fascinating to consider the opportunities for access and reduction in food waste they provide.
Sustainable Food Requires Collective Solutions
No single company or actor in the system can solve the challenges alone. Stepwise improvements will come through new thinking and partnerships to find collective solutions. We must revisit our relationships throughout the system and work interdependently toward win-win solutions.
Take, for example, Kellogg rice sourcing programs. As part of its Better Days Promise – environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategy, the company created a closed system experiment to pilot Kellogg's Ingrained™ program to help Lower Mississippi River Basin rice farmers reduce methane from the North American rice ingredient supply chain.
Kellogg provides training opportunities in irrigation management, nutrient management, and soil health to support farmers' transition to new practices, rewarding farmers per ton of GHG abatement their new methods achieve. Feedback from participating farmers will shape and improve the program's implementation in future years.
The Case for a Food System Innovation Coalition
Innovating for the future food system must be focused on more than just the planet. It provides an opportunity for companies to re-evaluate where there is opportunity. A necessary pivot is for these companies to explore what is competitive versus pre-competitive. When companies come together pre-competitively to innovate on sustainability, we unleash and scale their collective innovation capabilities to address a problem shared by all.  A rising tide will raise all boats! We must find ways to create opportunities for everyone within the system to generate the scale of change needed.
We believe that the largest food companies are those capable of creating transformative innovation at scale in our global food system. They have the resources and expertise to take an experimental approach within a sufficiently open/closed system, with a smaller set of actors to see what works and what doesn't. In this way, we will transform sustainability aspirations into reality.
At Kellogg Company (NYSE: K), our vision is a good and just world where people are not just fed but fulfilled. We are creating better days and a place at the table for everyone through our trusted food brands. Our beloved brands include Pringles®, Cheez-It®, Special K®, Kellogg's Frosted Flakes®, Pop-Tarts®, Kellogg's Corn Flakes®, Rice Krispies®, Eggo®, Mini-Wheats ®, Kashi®, RXBAR ®, MorningStar Farms ® and more. Net sales in 2021 were nearly $14.2 billion, comprised principally of snacks as well as convenience foods like cereal, frozen foods, and noodles. As part of our Kellogg's® Better Days   ESG strategy, we're addressing the interconnected issues of wellbeing, climate and food security, creating Better Days for 3 billion people by the end of 2030.

BRENTWOOD, Tenn., Nov. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Churchill Mortgage, an industry leader providing conventional, FHA, VA and USDA residential mortgages across 49 states and the District of Columbia, has hired Kisha Weir as vice president of sales for the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region. Weir will be responsible for the overall sales and business development operations while overseeing the training, mentorship and development of loan officers across the PNW division.
"In addition to being a natural servant leader with a proven track record of developing profitable branches throughout the west coast, Kisha has an undeniable desire to invest in people," said Kevin J. Hanna, president of the Churchill Mortgage Pacific Northwest region. "She will be an incredible asset to the team with her commitment to growth, empowering them to achieve their personal and professional goals. We're assembling a dream team to create something that hasn't been seen or done before in the mortgage industry. Our 'people over profits' approach, commitment to debt-free homeownership, and creation of a truly revolutionary platform will propel us to the top as we keep our clients and customers at the forefront of everything we do."
With over 30 years of experience in the mortgage industry, Weir has garnered impressive credentials managing sales teams in key senior roles and improving processes and efficiencies. Prior to joining Churchill Mortgage, Weir led the Western Division at Movement Mortgage, where she personally oversaw $11 billion in loan volume, and acted as senior vice president of the PNW Region at Eagle Home Mortgage, where she grew her area to the highest producing and most profitable region in the country. Weir was also named as one of Housing Wire's "Women of Influence" in 2021 and brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to the organization.
"This is a time of upward trajectory for Churchill Mortgage, and I am thrilled to facilitate their continued expansion in the Pacific Northwest and beyond," said Weir. "Rather than simply weathering and enduring this turbulent market, the company is staying on the offensive and embracing this as a time of opportunity for growth. Given the strong talent pipeline and Churchill's sterling reputation in the industry, this felt like a perfect fit and a place I truly belonged."
The announcement of Weir's hire corresponds with the recent growth and expansion of Churchill Mortgage's PNW division. The PNW division began in 2019 with just a single office in Portland and four team members. Last year, the regional division grew to 24 locations across seven states and surpassed $1 billion in annual loan volume. Headquartered in Portland, Churchill's PNW division has recently opened branches in several markets across the region, including Astoria, Ore.; Lake Oswego, Ore.; Bend, Ore.; Spokane, Wash.; Tacoma, Wash.; Sandpoint, Idaho; and Anchorage, Alaska.

HOUSTON, Nov. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport LNG) today provided an update on the ongoing reconstruction and resumption of operations at its natural gas liquefaction and LNG export facility. As of November 14 th , the reconstruction work necessary to commence initial operations, including utilization of all three liquefaction trains, two LNG storage tanks and one dock, was approximately 90% complete, with all reconstruction work anticipated to be completed by the end of November. Proposed remedial work activities for a safe restart of initial operations have been submitted to the relevant regulatory agencies for review and approval. Subject to Freeport LNG meeting its regulatory requirements, it is targeting initial production at the facility in mid-December.
Each of Freeport LNG's three liquefaction trains will be restarted and ramped up safely, in a slow and deliberate manner, with each train starting separately before restarting a subsequent train. It is expected that approximately 2 BCF per day of production will be achieved in January 2023. Full production utilizing both docks remains anticipated to commence in March 2023.
"Our teams have worked diligently over the last several months alongside regulators to ensure the safe restart of our facility. I am immensely grateful for their efforts," said Michael Smith, Founder, Chairman and CEO. "We are committed to moving forward with an uncompromising safety focus and enhanced operational processes that will enable us to chart a safe, sustainable path forward to serve our customers and the broader LNG market as a whole."
 ABOUT FREEPORT LNG

The company's three train, 15 MTPA liquefaction facility is the seventh largest in the world and second largest in the U.S. Freeport LNG's liquefaction facility is the largest all-electric drive motor plant of its kind in the world, making it the most environmentally sustainable site of its kind. The facility's electric drive motors reduce carbon emissions by over 90% relative to gas turbine-driven liquefaction facilities. Freeport plans to expand by adding a fourth liquefaction train, which has received all regulatory approvals for construction. Freeport was formed in 2002 to develop, own and operate an LNG terminal on Quintana Island, near Freeport, Texas. The terminal started LNG import operations in June 2008 and began LNG export operations in 2019. Further information can be found on Freeport's website at www.freeportlng.com.

PRINCETON, N.J., Nov. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- The Sozosei Foundation will hold its 3rd Annual Sozosei Summit to Decriminalize Mental Illness, December 5 to 7, 2022, in the Summit's home city of Philadelphia, PA, at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.
Within a month of opening registration for the Summit, in-person participation is at capacity. The Summit is a much-anticipated event for the field blending creativity, thought-provoking conversation, and experiential learning in order to accelerate the decriminalization of mental illness. A global and diverse audience comes together during the three-day event including thought leaders, people with lived experience, medical professionals, lawyers, judges, advocates, artists, and funders all working to build a world where mental illness is not a crime.
Tom Insel, MD, executive chair of Vanna Health and former head of the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH) said, "The Sozosei Summit brings together an incredibly diverse and robust group of people to forward the movement to decriminalize mental illness. Last year's Summit was a ground-breaking event that sparked tremendous momentum to address this critical issue. I am honored to once again be a part of an event that amplifies the voices of so many and challenges us all to think creatively to pursue real and lasting change."
Featuring more than 50 speakers and panelists, including Kristen Clarke, assistant attorney general for civil rights for the United States Department of Justice; Patrick Kennedy, former U.S. representative (D-RI) and founder of The Kennedy Forum; Greg McKeown, author of Essentialism and Effortless, and Zak Williams, son of the late Robin Williams and noted mental health advocate, the Summit will be live streamed for those who cannot attend in person.
Douglas Reed, director of partnerships and engagement at Black Men Heal and the host of the Let's Go Showpodcast, said, "I'm honored to be part of the 2022 Sozosei Summit. Last year's Summit highlighted the stories of those with real-life experience and surfaced great insights into addressing key issues to decriminalize mental illness. Real change happens when people of all backgrounds take the time to listen to one another and work together to solve problems."
Mental illness is not a crime. Jails and prisons cannot continue to be the nation's largest mental health care providers. Together, we can identify solutions that will increase access to mental health care in communities.

Full text: MILWAUKEE, Nov. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Ademi LLP is investigating Surrey (OTCPK: SRYB) for possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law in its transaction with First Community. 
Click here to learn how to join the action https://www.ademilaw.com/case/surrey-bancorp or call Guri Ademi toll-free at 866-264-3995.  There is no cost or obligation to you.
Ademi LLP alleges Surrey's financial outlook and prospects are excellent and yet Surrey holders will receive only 0.7159 shares of First Community common stock, which equates to $26.95 per share of Surrey common stock and an aggregate transaction value of approximately $113.2 million based on First Community's recent 10-day volume-weighted average price. The transaction agreement unreasonably limits competing bids for Surrey by imposing a significant penalty if Surrey accepts a superior bid. Surrey insiders will receive substantial benefits as part of change of control arrangements.
We are investigating the conduct of Surrey's board of directors, and whether they are (i) fulfilling their fiduciary duties to all shareholders, and (ii) obtaining a fair and reasonable price for Surrey.
If you own Surrey common stock and wish to obtain additional information, please contact Guri Ademi either at gademi@ademilaw.com or toll-free: 866-264-3995, or https://www.ademilaw.com/case/surrey-bancorp.

Shown at NAEYC Conference: Powerful Educational Program for Teaching the Earliest Learners  
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Showcasing as part of its new literacy solution at the NAEYC (National Association for the Education of Young Children) annual conference, Learning Without Tears' acclaimed Early Childhood curriculum, Get Set for School® (GSS), now includes Assessments to Guide Instruction (AGI), an addition to the complete program that provides greater value and more complete foundational learning. This new assessment tool allows educators to easily assess, track, and remediate student performance over the course of the school year. With AGI, teachers can easily provide updates and suggestions to families, building strong school-to-home connections, an important element of young learners' success. 
"Learning Without Tears has built a powerful literacy solution, based on the success we have had in early childhood education for more than 40 years," said Terry Nealon, CEO of Learning Without Tears. "Get Set for School is a central component of that literacy expertise and is already being used by thousands of schools across the country for kindergarten-readiness. Expanding GSS to include Assessments to Guide Instruction increases the impact LWT's literacy solution can have on very young learners. With a clear, individual assessment of what their students need at this early point in their education, teachers can create a lifelong learner and lover of reading, by understanding and then meeting students where they are." 
The award-winning Get Set for School complete curriculum is divided into six learning areas that seamlessly create a better academic outcome for pre-K students. Students are taught developmentally, learning the easiest skills first, then building on that knowledge as learning progresses. Multi-sensory activities provide hands-on learning and play-based opportunities for students to learn.
Assessment Matters
This complete pre-K curriculum prepares students for kindergarten in delightful ways, developing the foundational learning skills necessary for overall academic success. With the new Assessments to Guide Instruction, teachers can: 
- Identify the skills students need to improve 
- Enable data-driven enhancements of teacher-led instruction 
- Visualize student progress reports and share with families and administrators 
- Organize student assessments through a digital dashboard 
- Ensure student success over time, with digital progress monitoring 
- Remediate student skills with guided suggestions per unit 

The impact pandemic school shutdowns had on student progress will be measured and monitored for many upcoming years. But the Nation's Report Card from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, reported what many feared: student performance declined significantly, with lower performing students seeing a shaper decline than some of their peers. "Each early learner started school this year at a different spot," CEO Nealon explains. "Some students are starting preschool with foundational learning skills already in place, while other students still need to develop those building blocks of learning. Many of these young children have never been in a formal learning environment. All of this impacts student achievement and progress, and teachers need a way to identify each student's reading skills."
Assessment of each student's skills and progress is vital, so teachers have the data to know where each student is, in terms of learning. With assessment in place, teachers can tailor their instruction based on each students' performance, and then follow and track the progress students make as they get ready for kindergarten.
Get Set for School helps teachers keep students on-track for kindergarten-readiness in a simple way: by expanding early learning possibilities. Embedded Professional Development will empower and inspire teachers with real-time guided and just-in-time learning modules. Digital teaching tools, multi-sensory manipulatives, activities, play-based lessons, and a host of other important educational tools, are included in the complete version of GSS. 
In all elements of the GSS program, teachers are supported with guided lessons and other learning opportunities. Students access a hands-on curriculum that engages their minds and gives many kids a real love for reading. As a complete pre-K curriculum, Get Set for School aligns to standards developed by Head Start and the National Association for the Education of Young Children and addresses each subject area throughout the course of research-based instruction.
Get Set for School is eligible for federal funding sources. 
About Learning Without Tears Learning Without Tears is a leading early education company offering a proven and unique approach to teaching and learning, from crucial readiness skills in pre-K to foundational writing and typing skills, including handwriting, keyboarding and cursive. The elementary school-level programs benefit all learners with multisensory, developmentally appropriate, proven practices, and are used by millions of students around the world.

Full text: Contacts: Ariadna Figueroa (UNAVETS Spain), +34 691 496276, ariadna.figueroa@unavets.com / Oaktree contact, mediainquiries@oaktreecapital.com
LONDON, Nov. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The UNAVETS Group ("UNAVETS"), the leading veterinary healthcare group with 90+ practices across Spain and Portugal, announced today that it has raised an additional €116 million from Ares Management Credit funds.  Part of the capital will refinance existing debt with a significant majority reserved for future acquisition and capex funding to acquire veterinary hospitals and clinics and to continue acquisitions and investments in meaningful adjacencies.  UNAVETS is currently majority owned by funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management L.P. ("Oaktree").   
"We are thrilled Oaktree, and now Ares, as well, are backing our platform - helping to fuel our growth," says Junko Sheehan, CEO and Chairman of UNAVETS. "As we continue to evolve UNAVETS, this financing will give us additional firepower to invest strategically across the veterinary sector - meaning in people, facilities, equipment and innovation – to provide the best care for our pets and ongoing professional development and future for our vets."
Based on Ares' commitment and support, UNAVETS is now even better positioned to continue its successful strategy, employing more than 900 veterinary healthcare professionals and support staff in less than three years since its inception.  The executive team at UNAVETS all bring significant experience to bear both within the veterinary sector and from a business perspective.  The Company recently recruited Enrique Cardona (COO and Country Manager of Spain; formerly CEO of Vetsum) to the executive team, alongside Guilherme Assis (Country Manager of OneVet / Portugal), Aaron Sisternes (CFO), and Ignacio Gonzalez (Head of M&A and Expansion).  The full headquarters team of ~50 individuals are focused on providing support to all of the Clinical Directors and practice teams in the Group. 
In addition to supporting the Clinical teams with the necessary resources to continue to grow and evolve, UNAVETS is also continuing to grow inorganically via M&A.  The Company has invested creatively across the veterinary healthcare sector, placing capital strategically in adjacent areas which are synergistic with its current portfolio, which has also helped to accelerate its growth.  Karim Khairallah, Managing Director and Co-Portfolio Manager of the European Principal Group at Oaktree, comments, "The UNAVETS platform has seen very strong growth since inception and its management team has positioned the business well for the next stage of organic and inorganic growth. The Ares financing is a testament of this and provides UNAVETS with the right long term growth funding that is needed in this sector.  Oaktree's European Principal Group has worked closely with Ares on multiple transactions, specifically in buy and build strategies, and Ares has brought a flexible and tailored financing solution that fits UNAVETS' growth needs." 
The veterinary sector in Iberia has undergone a phase shift in consolidation over the last couple years and more than likely this trend will only accelerate over the coming few years.  In addition to the natural trend towards consolidation, research reports have continued to see that overall people are not easily willing to compromise on healthcare spending for their family members, which now include their pets.  Alonso Torre de Silva, Managing Director in the Ares Credit Group in Madrid, comments, "The veterinary healthcare sector continues to demonstrate strong growth despite broader economic headwinds, demonstrating strong forecast fundamentals and recession resilience. Ares is pleased to provide capital to UNAVETS as it continues to build on its record of rapid growth and disciplined performance."
UNAVETS and Oaktree were advised by Houlihan Lokey on corporate finance, EY on tax and Weil Gotshal & Manges and Cuatrecasas on the legal aspects of the deal. Ares received legal advice from Macfarlanes and Uría Menéndez.

Full text: Newly designed courts created in partnership with Project Backboard and local artists were unveiled during special community events in San Francisco, California, and Columbia, South Carolina
ATLANTA and PURCHASE, N.Y., Nov. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Buffalo Wild Wings ® and Mtn Dew Legend ® recruited basketball superstars Klay Thompson and A'ja Wilson to surprise local communities in San Francisco, CA and Columbia, SC, with refurbished basketball courts ahead of the holiday season. In partnership with nonprofit Project Backboard, this all-star team worked with local artists to build fun and inspiring places for youth athletes to grow their love for the game.
On November 9, 4X Champion and 5X All-Star, Klay Thompson hit the court in California to unveil the upgraded and redesigned space at KIPP San Francisco College Preparatory school. The new court features the work of local artist Abriella Sammy and Luis Perez of Hero Flooring, LLC. Excited KIPP students and school officials packed the gym and participated in an epic 3-point competition hosted by Thompson, a phenomenal shooting guard known for his signature shot.
"Having an inspiring place to play is important to any athlete, which is why partnering with Buffalo Wild Wings and Mtn Dew Legend to revamp this court for the community has been so rewarding," said Thompson. "San Francisco has become my home and I care about this community deeply --I cannot wait to see the future legends that will dominate the game on this new court."
Simultaneously, across the country on November 12, power forward A'ja Wilson visited her hometown of Columbia, SC to unveil a new community court at Hyatt Park. The 2X MVP and 4X All-Star addressed the crowd and performed a ceremonial "first layup" on the revamped court designed by local artists, Charmaine Minniefield and Cienna Minniefield .  
"Growing up in South Carolina and having a space to call my 'home court' has shaped me into the person and athlete that I am today," said A'ja Wilson. "I chose to upgrade the basketball court at Hyatt Park, near my grandparents' house, to provide this incredible community with a space for the next generation of legends to play and perfect their craft. I'm grateful to partner with Buffalo Wild Wings and Mtn Dew Legend to give back to the place that has given me so much."
"Our partnership with Buffalo Wild Wings is all about celebrating sports and creating incredible experiences for the fans that love them," said Scott Finlow, Chief Marking Officer, PepsiCo Global Foodservice. "This community effort was a big win for us. It was an honor to partner with Buffalo Wild Wings and basketball legends, Klay and A'ja, to create something special for these communities and support these local athletes as they make legendary moves on and off the court."  
"Whether watching or playing sports, we understand that the environment can sometimes make or break the experience," said Stuart Brown, Executive Director of Buffalo Wild Wings Foundation. "It's our hope that by reimagining these courts with Mtn Dew Legend and two legendary basketball players, we're fueling the champions of the next generation."
The refurbished courts at KIPP San Francisco College Preparatory in San Francisco, CA and Hyatt Park in Columbia, SC are officially open and ready for the legends of tomorrow to make their mark. Fans can stay up to date on the latest by following @BWW and @MountainDew on Twitter and Instagram.  
This court refurbishing program is an extension of the longstanding relationship between Buffalo Wild Wings and PepsiCo. Earlier this year, the pair unveiled Mtn Dew Legend, a new, exclusive flavor of Mtn Dew that delivers a bold burst of blackberry flavor and serves as the perfect assist to Buffalo Wild Wings' extensive menu of gameday favorites.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --
"Our family is heartbroken by our beloved Devin's tragic and violent death. Devin was an extraordinary young man who lit up the room with his bright, radiant smile and personality. He loved to sing, dance, and of course, play football. He was passionate about helping people and never shied away from working hard on the football field and in the classroom. Devin was motivated by his ambitions to play in the NFL and inspired other young people to dream big dreams as he did.
Although our hearts are aching, we are incredibly blessed and grateful for the prayers, overwhelming acts of kindness and words of healing our family has received since his passing. Devin's friends and former teammates from across the country have been so kind and gracious in offering their condolences and support, which has brought me great comfort.
We also extend our deepest appreciation to the University of Virginia administration, athletics department, faculty, students, and alumni for their phone calls, cards, and heartfelt generosity during this time.
To the family and friends of Lavel Davis Jr. and D'Sean Perry, you are in our thoughts and prayers as you, too, begin the healing process after the loss of your sons. Lastly, to the Hollins and Morgan families and all those left traumatized by this senseless tragedy, we are holding you close and praying for God's healing power in all our lives."
To celebrate the life and legacy of Devin, his family has created The Devin Chandler Memorial Fund at the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation. For those interested in supporting the fund, visit the donor page or mail donations to: The Devin Chandler Memorial Fund, c/o the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation, 114 4th Street SE, Charlottesville, VA 22902.

Full text: PORTLAND, Ore., Nov. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- After having successfully brought in-clinic respiratory monitoring services to primary care facilities for the first time in 2022, VitalFlo has announced the launch of home-based virtual care services in partnership with Allergy & Asthma Network (AAN). Patients that are enrolled in the service by their provider will be sent home with VitalFlo's respiratory monitoring platform, and receive regular monitoring and coaching courtesy of AAN's certified Asthma Educators. The service will be made available to all VitalFlo customers in early 2023.
"High quality, virtual respiratory health care has been our number one most requested feature for some time," said Luke Marshall, CEO and Founder, VitalFlo. "Through this partnership with a network of respiratory health experts, we will now be able to offer care when and where patients need it: all without requiring any more of our customers' valuable clinical staff time."
The service's first participating practice will be Family Allergy & Asthma. With 95 board-certified allergists serving more than 100 offices in Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee, patients should see positive impact almost immediately.
Dr. James L. Sublett, MD, Co-Founder and Chief Medical Officer of Family Allergy & Asthma, was enthusiastic about the program. "As a group, we've always been primarily focused on improving the quality of care for patients through early intervention," said Sublett. "Being able to bring high-quality care to the patients in their home environment will be a game changer for our most-vulnerable patients."
With a suite of tools for pulmonary function testing, VitalFlo helps doctors rapidly assess the respiratory health of their asthma patients -- both in the clinic and at home -- and to update patient care plans. Through advanced trends, patient status alerts, and detailed analytics, VitalFlo's unified digital health platform enables proactive and responsive management of respiratory diseases and conditions by clinical teams, improving the quality of life for all those afflicted.

MONTREAL, Nov. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - (NYSE: CAE); (TSX: CAE) CAE is proud to have been named one of Canada's Top 100 Employers. This prestigious designation recognizes Canadian employers leading their industries and creating innovative programs to offer exceptional workplaces to their employees. According to Mediacorp Canada Inc., organizers of the annual competition, this year's Canada's Top 100 Employers are leading by listening, tapping into employee feelings and sentiments about the many challenges of the past year.
"At CAE, our people are at the heart of everything we do. We are a proud global company with deep Canadian roots providing a collaborative, innovative and forward-thinking work environment," said Marc Parent, President and Chief Executive Officer of CAE.

Some of the flexible and collaborative programs that CAE has introduced in recent years include the following:
- CAEheartbeat is a global transformation initiative designed to advance CAE's focus and commitment to being human-centric, ensuring our people are our top priority. CAE remains committed to providing policies that better support the wellbeing of employees and allow the work-life harmony they need. The first initiative under the CAEheartbreat umbrella is a flexible vacation policy launched in August 2022.


- CAEcontinuum is a flexible work program. With the pandemic, remote working became the norm for many employees at companies worldwide. As restrictions eased, CAEcontinuum has allowed employees to split their time between working from home and the office.


- CAE officially marked its 75th anniversary on March 17, 2022. CAE's 75th Anniversary Launch Event, held on March 24, kicked off an entire year of celebrations for CAE employees.


- Diversity, equity and inclusion are part of CAE's values and strategy. CAE has seven employee resource groups, including a new group for Indigenous Peoples created in 2022.

"The CAEheartbeat and CAEcontinuum initiatives are perfect examples of how a global company can be agile and embrace new ways of working, allowing their dedicated and talented teams to thrive," said Dan Sharkey, senior vice president, Global Human Resources.

Full text: Honeymoon registry pioneer deploys $1.55 million in funding to power 'happily ever after' with cash-gifting websites for marriage
CLEARWATER, Fla., Nov. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --  Honeyfund , the company that pioneered the unique, honeymoon-focused wedding registry, is disrupting the wedding space once again with a new wedding website that can drive marital strength and satisfaction. Recent research conducted by the company demonstrated that couples who honeymoon and travel regularly have happier marriages. However, some couples are at risk of missing out on this marriage-fortifying trip of a lifetime due to financial, career and demographic constraints, like education and race.
The survey completed by 1,000 married couples in the U.S. showed that of those who were married for more than 11 years and rated their marital satisfaction as 'excellent,' 59% of them went on a honeymoon versus 35% who didn't. Along with this, 84% of these couples continue to travel together regularly.
This data, coupled with the hardships placed on couples by the pandemic, has driven a renewed focus on Honeyfund's mission of making honeymoons happen for all couples. But the company is not stopping there. With the help of a $1.55 million crowdfunded investment , Honeyfund is expanding the award-winning cash-based gifting platform to power not just the honeymoon, but the "happily ever after" and beyond – events like babies, anniversaries, even unexpected hardships. To start, the company has released cash-gift-powered wedding websites with dozens of new designs to bring each couple's unique personality forward on a page they can keep with them throughout their marriage.
"For more than 16 years, Honeyfund has been helping couples fund their honeymoons. But we didn't realize how important our work was for marital satisfaction," said Sara Margulis, Honeyfund co-founder and CEO. "Honeyfund's new wedding websites and page designs are just the beginning of our mission to strengthen marriage beyond the wedding day, and hopefully, reduce the overall divorce rate."
Couples can use the new and improved Honeyfund page as their primary wedding website and/or as an alternative gift registry where they can receive cash for their honeymoon, wedding, home down payment – anything they are saving for. However they choose to do it, couples are able to create a page that fits their unique style and that their friends and family find fun and easy to use for gifting.
For more information on Honeyfund, visit honeyfund.com .
About Honeyfund As the most trusted honeymoon registry and wedding fund service since 2006, Honeyfund is all about making dreams come true and making marriages stronger from the start. With a Honeyfund page, wedding gifts become cash in couples' hands to travel the world together, fund their wedding day or any savings goal.

Full text: Stella Rosa® Wines will donate $1 for every "Country With A Flare" ticket sold for their Future is Female  Music Series, approx. $33k and counting
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Stella Rosa® Wines partnered up with Lainey Wilson for her upcoming tour "Country With A Flare – presented by Stella Rosa® Future Is Female" to raise support for female representation across the music industry. In collaboration with We Are Moving the Needle , a nonprofit organization supporting all women recording industry professionals, Stella Rosa® will donate $1 for every tour ticket sold, approximately $33k and counting.
Six-time CMA Awards nominee, Lainey Wilson, is just getting started – winning both Female Vocalist of the Year and New Artist of the Year, as the only female nominated in the category, at the 2022 CMA Awards earlier this month. Lainey Wilson has previously been named ACM's 2022 New Female Artist of the Year, CMT's 2022 Breakout Artist of the Year, and Billboard's Top New Country Artist of 2021, solidifying her star power and leadership as an artist in the country music space.
"We joined forces with Lainey Wilson at the perfect time and we are honored to support her during this monumental tour for her career," said Steve Riboli, President of Stella Rosa® Wines and Riboli Family Wines. "Not only is she an incredible role model and advocate for female empowerment, but she is also the ultimate partner for our Stella Rosa® Future is Female campaign and aligns with our goal to reach and support up-and-coming female voices."
Stella Rosa® Future Is Female is a music series consisting of national tours and curated consumer events that showcase and Stellabrate the Stella Rosa® portfolio and why it's the ultimate brand for the brightest new female voices across various music genres. Lainey Wilson's tour will kick off the initiative on January 4, 2023 and will include 27 cities across the country, including Irving Plaza in New York City, The Showbox SoDo in Seattle, and The Signal in Tennessee, among others.
"This has been such a crazy year, from winning two CMA awards to making my acting debut in Yellowstone , I'm still processing it all," says country music star, Lainey Wilson. "But 2023 is going to be even more special – I'm headlining my own tour for the first time with the support of Stella Rosa ® Wines. I love what they stand for and am so grateful for their support during this wild time in my career. It's gonna be a helluva tour!"
Lainey Wilson's tour, Country With A Flare , reflects Lainey's depth and multifaceted character with elements of '70s Rock, Funk, and Soul, but is country at its core. Lainey will be performing songs from her new album, Bell Bottom Country, including hit single, "Heart Like a Truck," which is currently climbing radio charts, as well as her latest releases, "Live Off," and "Watermelon Moonshine." Across the album, Lainey reveals her dynamism and makeup as a woman who is vulnerable, empowering, and above all else, real.
"Just like Lainey's story, Stella Rosa® Future Is Female is on a mission to support female voices with a unique story to tell," says Andrea Cromaz, VP of Marketing for Stella Rosa® Wines. "Lainey's immeasurable growth as an artist is a perfect example of harnessing the power of who you are, and we want to encourage all women in the music industry to tap into their authentic selves and flourish in the same way."

ABOUT LAINEY WILSON:
CMA 2022 Female Vocalist of the Year, CMA 2022 New Artist of the Year, and ACM's 2022 New Female Artist of the Year, Lainey Wilson has earned the enthusiasm of the industry. Having been named to nearly every "Artist to Watch" list, being crowned Billboard's "Top New Country Artist of 2021," and earning CMT's 2022 "Breakout Artist of the Year" honor, the Louisiana native is one of Nashville's hottest and most buzzed-about new artists. Landing her first No. 1 with her PLATINUM Certified ACM Song of the Year "Things A Man Oughta Know," nearly 10 years to the day after leaving her small farming community in a camper trailer to chase her dreams, she has won over legions of fans with her signature Bell Bottom Country sound and aesthetic, which blends traditional Country with a modern yet retro flare. A prolific and sought-after songwriter (having co-writer credits on songs by artists including Luke Combs, Flatland Calvary and more), Lainey is a fresh, fierce voice in Nashville, delivering CMA nominated album of the year with her label debut, Sayin' What I'm Thinkin'. With a rockstar stage presence, her artistry has taken her across the globe, performing for sold-out crowds throughout the US, UK, and Germany with notable names like Jon Pardi, Luke Combs, Morgan Wallen, HARDY, Jason Aldean, Ashley McBryde, and more. After topping the country radio charts for a second time with the two-week No. 1 hit, "Never Say Never" with Cole Swindell, her current single "Heart Like a Truck" and HARDY collaboration "wait in the truck" are Top 20 and climbing. Her new album, "Bell Bottom Country," is out now and she can currently be seen starring in Season 5 of the hit series, "Yellowstone," and was recently named "Tractor Supply Brand Ambassador," adding to her growing list of endeavors.

BERLOOK Pledges 1% of its Revenue to Global Climate Change Initiative
HONG KONG, Nov. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- BERLOOK, the woman's swimwear brand that focuses on eco-friendly materials to minimize the environmental impact of wardrobes, is donating 1% of its revenue to Stripe Climate, a global initiative of businesses coming together to fund technology to tackle climate change.
Excessive carbon emissions has become an increasing global concern in recent years, due to its association with global warming. As one of the world's biggest industries, the fashion industry plays an important role in sustainability and has a collective corporate social responsibility (CSR) for reducing carbon emissions in the production and consumption of textiles and garments.
Over the last decade, an increasing number of prominent companies in the world of fashion have embraced this collective responsibility and launched environmental protection initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable development.
BERLOOK, as a sustainable fashion brand, was born in 2021 and is committed to providing eco-friendly products to customers from all around the world. BERLOOK's commitment to the environment is seen in every stitch of our fabrics. Materials are 100% natural or recyclable fabric, such as lyocell and linen. BERLOOK's pledge to give 1% of their revenue to Stripe Climate, since September 2022, is a core part of our CSR efforts towards environmental protection and sustainability.
The new sustainable swimwear collection made with recycled materials certified with the Global Recycled Standard (GRS) was launched in the 2022 summer season. Every piece was created with exceptional craftsmanship and ethical production, allowing our customers to feel completely comfortable. Up to now, 40% of our cooperative factories have BSCI verification and 20% have WRAP verification. We are committed to achieving 100% ethical verification of cooperative factories by 2025.
BERLOOK believes sustainability will play a more and more important role in brand development and is committed to promoting eco-friendly business through all aspects of the business model. BERLOOK will pay more attention to improvement in sustainable and ethical production and join more environment protection events to make sustainability be a part of the BERLOOK brand DNA.

Full text: SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Travel platform, TRAVUT published by REDBIK Co., Ltd opens a real-time travel information service, Handy Info Center , to provide travelers with the right travel information at right time. 
Handy Info Center  is open to any international travelers in or planning to visit Korea for free of charge. It is a chat-based travel assistant service that responds flexibly in a variety of circumstances which allows travelers to ask for their travel needs such as directions, and price information in emergency situations.
TRAVUT started with private tour services focusing on its 'Local Guide Matching' business. Still difficult to get instantaneous information from Google or other map applications, especially after COVID-19, many overseas travelers get non-updated information from Korean portal sites or social media up until now. In fact, TRAVUT revealed that the main inquiries from Handy Info Center include restaurant dress expectations, whether halal restaurants are still open after COVID-19, transportation, K-beauty shops, and spa & massage reservations.
Moreover, TRAVUT not only offers its 'Local Guide Matching' service but also travel curation service for guests in 27 hotels including five-stars. Providing services in English for now, TRAVUT plans to offer various languages such as Chinese and Arabic.
TRAVUT, offering P2P (Peer to Peer) on-demand travel services to individual travelers, will expand its business to Southeast Asia next year based on the actual database from VIP travelers from the U.S.A., the Middle East, and Europe.

Full text: "Preacher Spurs" from Christian Faith Publishing author Lamont H. Fuchs, Ed.D. is a heartfelt message of understanding the challenges faced by many working within the ministry and presents helpful topics for developing weekly sermons.
MEADVILLE, Pa., Nov. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- "Preacher Spurs": a useful pastoral resource that will aid and encourage. "Preacher Spurs" is the creation of published author Lamont H. Fuchs, Ed.D., who was a Chapter President and State Representative with Heaven's Saints Motorcycle Ministry for ten years, founding BikerDownLiftedUp.org in 2009 to serve motorcycle accident victims. Dr. Fuchs lives in Western North Carolina, where he finished a career in Buncombe County public schools. His education consists of an AA in Audio-Visual Technology, a BS in Computer Management, an MEd in Educational Technology, and an EdD in Education Administration, emphasizing Educational Technology. In addition, Dr. Fuchs has forty-five years of administrating educational technology for both military and public education programs. He is married with two grown children and originally hails from Billings, Montana.
Dr. Fuchs shares, "The inspiration of God to teach daily or preach weekly is a blessing and a burden. It is a blessing to have the week-after-week encouragement to preach your sermons with your original topics. However, for some, it is a burden because there is a Sunday morning sermon expected, and the inspiration to provide a message to preach God's Word must be roused, researched, and gathered into a logical presentation.
"Tag. You're it. Sometimes, it's just not there. You know Sunday is coming, and sometimes the stimulus or impetus is not. I empathize. These are the reasons I authored this book.
"The truth is, some preachers are good enough to not only preach on Sunday morning, but also follow that sermon with another on Sunday night and Wednesday night or another day of the week. They are always, always ready in season or out of season to preach the Gospel. But there are times in the career of every pastor when they struggle when the inspiration to create sermons fades after months and years of multiple weekly presentations. Especially during periods of life when events and tribulations require time and dedication to other pressing matters.
"Others might say, 'It's their job. That is what they do.' They get paid to read and study and make a forty-minute sermon each time they stand behind the pulpit. Not true. You and I know that. Most pastors/preachers do so much more than preach. They have families, a flock to attend to, and administrative duties that take much of their week. Some of you—bless your heart—are bi-vocational and work a forty-hour week as well. Not an easy job even for the called who are in love to do all they can in Jesus's name and for His glory. This book of Preacher Spurs is for them."
Published by Christian Faith Publishing, Lamont H. Fuchs, Ed.D.'s new book brings assistance to both new and established pastors and ministers.
Dr. Fuchs draws from his many years of service within the ministry to present readers with helpful and uplifting advice for sermon building.
Consumers can purchase "Preacher Spurs" at traditional brick & mortar bookstores, or online at Amazon.com, Apple iTunes store, or Barnes and Noble.

TAIPEI, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Delta Electronics Foundation has participated in the 27th Conference of the Parties (COP27) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt by hosting a side event and an Action Hub event on November 16, in which it shared its coral restoration initiative with the international climate science community in collaboration with the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium, the Partnership for Observation of Global Ocean (POGO), and the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF). High temperature-tolerant coral genes and blue carbon ecosystems were also part of the event discussion, which overall received enthusiastic responses from international opinion leaders.
Wim Chang, CEO of the Delta Electronics Foundation, stated, "Delta started this coral restoration project on its 50th anniversary, and we have reached the goal of planting 1,000 corals ahead of schedule by the end of this year. We will continue to work with the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium, the National Museum of Marine Science & Technology and conservation groups to achieve the goal of planting another 10,000 corals over the next three years. In addition to supporting the basic research on heat-tolerant corals and ensuring genetic diversity, we also utilize Delta LED lighting and automation technologies to enhance biodiversity that contributes to restore the marine ecosystems around Taiwan, which are threatened by increasingly frequent marine heatwaves. These ecosystems may gradually recover after we  achieve net-zero emissions goals."
Te-Hao Chen, Vice Director of the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium, also visited Egypt in person to share the progress of Taiwan's research on the cultivation of heat-tolerant corals and gene preservation. He stated that the Aquarium will be committed to selecting and cultivating heat-tolerant corals to develop a "coral ark" where live coral culture and gene banks can be created on site.
Margaret Leinen, the POGO's representative and an international expert, shared the endeavors made by the Ocean Biomolecular Observing Network (OBON) and how to contribute to coral reef ecology through observation. Yu-Hsuan Yeh, Campaigner of the EJF, focused on the issue of blue carbon assets in the ocean and further stated that carbon can be sequestered and stored through a well-functioning blue carbon ecosystem, thereby alleviating climate change effects.
Different from the traditional conferences, Action Hub is held in a semi-open space in the Blue Zone to allow participants to participate freely. The Delta Electronics Foundation also shared the Restoration Scheme NFT that it recently launched by joining hands with Asia University and Formosa Art Bank DAO (FAB DAO) at the event, with the aim of increasing public attention through diverse issues. Meanwhile, the Delta Electronics Foundation set up a booth in the Blue Zone during COP27 to display coral restoration equipment, which also facilitated the exchange of ideas with several international climate advocates.

Company outlines key near term performance indicators
NEW YORK, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) expects its rapidly growing portfolio of electric vehicles will be solidly profitable in 2025 in North America as the company scales EV capacity in the region to more than 1 million units annually, ramps up its software revenue opportunities, generates significant greenhouse gas benefits and realizes the positive impacts of new clean energy tax credits, the company told investors today at a meeting in New York City.
"GM's ability to grow EV sales is the payoff for many years of investment in R&D, design, engineering, manufacturing, our supply chain and a new EV customer experience that is designed to be the best in the industry," said GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra. "Our multi-brand, multi-segment, multi price point EV strategy gives us incredible leverage to grow revenue and market share, and we believe our Ultium Platform and vertical integration will allow us to continuously improve battery performance and costs." 
Strong Foundation to Drive EV Growth
In the next three years, GM plans to move very aggressively toward EV leadership as EV adoption is expected to approach 20% of U.S. industry sales in 2025:
- GM will have multiple entries in pickup, SUV and luxury segments that represent about 70% of EV industry volume, including the Chevrolet Silverado EV, Blazer EV and Equinox EV, the Cadillac LYRIQ and the GMC Sierra EV
- GM is launching a new digital retail platform with its U.S. dealer partners to enhance the shopping and purchase experience for EV customers and reduce costs to GM by an estimated $2,000 per vehicle
- Five GM assembly plants in the U.S., Canada and Mexico will be building EVs
- BrightDrop — GM's tech startup creating EVs, eCarts and software — is on track to reach $1 billion in revenue in 2023, as GM's CAMI plant in Ontario launches full production of the BrightDrop Zevo 600 delivery van next year, and scaling to a projected 50,000 units annually by 2025
- GM's battery cell joint venture Ultium Cells will be operating plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Michigan by the end of 2024, making the company a leader in domestic cell production; a fourth U.S. cell plant is planned
- GM has secured binding commitments for all the battery raw material it needs to deliver its 2025 capacity target
- The company continues to secure its needs beyond 2025 with strategic supply agreements and direct investments in natural resource recovery, processing and recycling
- GM's EV growth is supported by a highly profitable portfolio of internal combustion engine vehicles in North America, including market-leading pickups and SUVs, great quality, and consistently high scores for customer satisfaction with dealer sales and service

In 2023, Chevrolet and GMC will press their advantage in the pickup market with the new 2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD and GMC Sierra HD, which will be available in the first half of 2023, as well as the new Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon mid-size pickups. 
Investor Roadmap
During the meeting with investors, Paul Jacobson, GM executive vice president and chief financial officer, updated the company's 2022 guidance and provided several key performance indicators to help investors track the company's transformation and financial performance through 2025, all of which exclude the positive benefits from the recently passed clean energy tax credits. 
"We've built the foundation to rapidly scale our EV portfolio, make it profitable and maintain strong margins during a period of high investment," said Jacobson. "Our Ultium Platform and battery technology will only get better and less expensive over time, and we have enterprise-wide momentum in EVs, Cruise, software-defined vehicles and new businesses like BrightDrop that will help us achieve our revenue and margin targets by the end of the decade."
GM now projects full-year 2022 adjusted automotive free cash flow will increase to $10-11 billion from its previous guidance of $7-9 billion. GM now projects 2022 EBIT-adjusted for the full year will be in a range of $13.5-14.5 billion, compared to its previous guidance of $13-15 billion.
GM's 2023-2025 key performance indicators include:
- Total company revenue is expected to grow at a 12% compound annual rate through 2025, reaching more than $225 billion as EV volumes and software revenue grow. Revenue from EVs is expected to be more than $50 billion in 2025.
- GM expects to build 400,000 EVs in North America from 2022 through the first half of 2024 and grow capacity to 1 million units annually in North America in 2025.
- GM expects to reach U.S. battery cell capacity of more than 160 GWh and 1.2 million cells per day by mid-decade.
- GM is focused on reducing the cell costs for the next generation of its Ultium batteries to under $70/kWh by mid- to late-decade
- Total capital spending is expected to be $11-13 billion per year through 2025, funded by ongoing healthy cash flows.
- GM expects to maintain its historical EBIT-adjusted margins of 8-10% in North America through this growth investment period.
- GM expects to earn low- to mid-single-digit EBIT-adjusted margins on its EV portfolio in 2025, before the positive impact of clean energy tax credits. 

General Motors  (NYSE:GM) is a global company focused on advancing an all-electric future that is inclusive and accessible to all. At the heart of this strategy is the Ultium battery platform, which will power everything from mass-market to high-performance vehicles. General Motors, its subsidiaries and its joint venture entities sell vehicles under the  Chevrolet,   Buick,   GMC,   Cadillac ,  Baojun  and  Wuling  brands.

Full text: Uber Platform to Facilitate Delivery of Purchases from Participating NRS Neighborhood Stores
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- National Retail Solutions (NRS), operator of the leading point-of-sale (POS) platform for independent convenience stores, bodegas, tiendas and other neighborhood retailers, today announced a partnership with Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: UBER). 
As a part of the partnership, NRS's nationwide network of participating independent retailers will be able to offer same-day delivery to their customers by utilizing Uber Direct. Uber Direct allows businesses to seamlessly own the customer experience end-to-end and handle on-demand delivery orders.  NRS' POS network for independent retailers in the U.S. comprises over 20,000 active POS terminals operating in over 17,000 stores.  Deliveries will be provided at no cost to the NRS retailer when the purchases are made through the BR Club app.
Independent, neighborhood merchants often operate at a disadvantage to larger competitors because of a lack of scale and resources.  More recently, new entrants in the rapid grocery and convenience delivery space have specifically targeted the customers served by these neighborhood retailers putting further pressure on the independent stores. NRS and Uber are working together to address this threat and help independent community businesses succeed by enabling same-day delivery that leverages  the synergies of the NRS and Uber platforms and capabilities.
"NRS was built specifically to empower independent retailers in urban and underserved neighborhoods and communities all across America," said Elie Y. Katz, President and Chief Executive Officer of NRS. "The NRS POS platform supports our retailers nationwide, providing them with powerful transaction processing and store management tools, security features, payment processing, and digital marketing services that enable them to compete more effectively.  Our partnership with Uber combines the power of our two companies' platforms to enable same-day delivery  of purchases made via our e-commerce channels from these retailers.  Uber has been exceptional in working with us to help strengthen independent neighborhood stores and the communities they serve."
"Since its inception, Uber has striven to make inroads providing accessibility and opportunity to underserved markets," said Jason McHale, Uber Direct Managing Partner . "Our partnership with NRS will give small, local bodegas and grocery stores an opportunity to expand their reach through delivery and make more money, which is something we all should be excited about." 
"Bodegas and other small neighborhood stores are the backbone of every New York City community," said New York City Council Member Julie Menin, Chair of the New York City Small Business Committee.  "The influx of rapid grocery delivery companies over the last couple of years has put a strain on these retailers and threatened our small businesses. Uber's partnership with NRS can provide relief by helping update critical technological systems and offering delivery that is free for the merchant."

BOSTON, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Indigo Agriculture, a company leveraging nature and technology to unlock economic and environmental progress for farmers, today announced the appointment of Andreas Fibig, former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of International Flavors and Fragrances, Inc., to its Board of Directors. As a member of the board, Fibig will provide insight and support as Indigo expands access to its sustainability solutions to Consumer-Packaged Goods (CPG) and corporate customers around the world.
"Indigo will greatly benefit from Andreas' deep understanding of the CPG world and the needs of a global food supply chain increasingly focused on sustainability, and the demand signals that creates for agribusinesses and farmers alike," said Indigo CEO Ron Hovsepian. "As COP27 has shown us, climate and the environment are the most pressing issues facing our planet. Our recent accomplishments show how we can successfully use science and technology to address our biggest agricultural challenges, creating new revenue streams for all market participants.

His background and extensive network across both European and U.S. ag and food markets will accelerate Indigo's growth as it catalyzes change in the global ag and food ecosystem.
At IFF, an industry leader in food ingredients, beverage, scent, health, and biosciences, Fibig led the company through its own transformational period. This included overseeing the integration of DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences into the company, leading the organization's heralded sustainability efforts, and driving strong sales growth. He spent 10 years at IFF, the last seven as Chairman and CEO. Prior to that he served as President and Chairman of the Board of Management for Bayer Health Care Pharmaceuticals, where he was the chief executive responsible for Bayer's global pharmaceutical business. Fibig also previously served on the Boards of Directors for Bunge Limited a leading global agribusiness and food company, and Novo Nordisk, a leading global healthcare company.
"I am thrilled to have Andreas further strengthen Indigo's board. With his extensive network amongst industry leaders across agriculture, food, and consumer goods, he will be instrumental in helping us build crucial industry alliances to help accelerate Indigo's growth," said Robert Berendes, Chairman of Indigo Ag Board of Directors.
"I'm excited to join the Indigo board at this pivotal moment. The company's record of progress in science and technology – successfully producing the world's first crop of registry-issued ag carbon credits at scale, expanding industry-leading biological seed treatments, and developing second-generation digital merchandising solutions – is helping set the standard for a new class of sustainability solutions," said Fibig. "I'm looking forward to joining Indigo on their journey and leveraging agriculture to move the needle on ESG responsibility."

Full text: Firm to oversee significant rail enhancement projects for CSX Transportation and the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority
PITTSBURGH, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Michael Baker International, a global leader in engineering, planning and consulting services, announced today that the firm has been selected by CSX Transportation (CSXT) to lead program and construction management for significant rail enhancement projects as part the Transforming Rail in Virginia (TRV) initiative. The TRV program represents an innovative public/private partnership, which also includes the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), Amtrak and Virginia Railway Express (VRE) commuter rail operator as key stakeholders. This work is being completed in conjunction with the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority (VPRA), the lead state agency for TRV, and encompasses the design and construction of multiple projects between Washington, DC, and Richmond, Virginia, totaling $3.7 billion.
"Michael Baker has a history of overseeing rail and transit projects for more than 40 rail carriers throughout the country, providing innovative solutions that enable our clients to achieve their goals and ultimately, enhance the transportation of freight," said Kirsten Bowen, National Director, Freight Rail at Michael Baker International. "I am thrilled that the Michael Baker team, supported by Patrick Engineering, is servicing CSXT on this exciting infrastructure project that will transform rail in Virginia, as well as the Rail and Transit Practice at Michael Baker. "
Michael Baker will provide program management and construction management services for TRV project delivery over the next 10 years. The firm will serve as owner-representative, collaborating with various design consultants to provide pre-construction and construction phase services including design reviews, project controls and construction management/ inspection for multiple bridges, walls, track and associated infrastructure.
A leading supplier of rail-based freight transportation, CSXT operates more than 2,000 miles of track throughout the state of Virginia. VPRA, created in 2020, will gain control of 350 miles of railroad right-of-way and 225 miles of existing track from CSXT as TRV capital investments are completed, enabling expanded passenger rail services. Once Virginia completes construction of a separate passenger rail corridor along this section of track, Virginia and CSXT will benefit from freight-dedicated tracks free of passenger rail traffic. This will lead to enhanced passenger rail service, such as more frequent Amtrak state-supported trains and a near doubling of VRE Fredericksburg Line commuter service to include new late-night and weekend service.

TORONTO and DETROIT, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Vale Canada Limited, a subsidiary of Vale S.A., and General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM), announced today they have signed a term sheet for the long-term supply of battery grade nickel sulfate from Vale's proposed plant at Bécancour, Québec, Canada. This agreement secures for GM a supply of nickel sulfate from a U.S. free-trade partner to support its fast-growing EV production needs in North America.
Under terms of the agreement, Vale will supply battery grade nickel sulfate, equivalent to 25,000 metric tons per year of contained nickel, for use in GM's Ultium battery cathodes, which will power a broad portfolio of electric vehicles including the Chevrolet Silverado EV, Blazer EV and Equinox EV, the Cadillac LYRIQ, the GMC Sierra EV, and the GMC HUMMER EV Pickup and SUV. The amount of contained nickel is sufficient to supply approximately 350,000 EVs annually. Deliveries are targeted to commence in the second half of 2026.
This initiative highlights Vale's uniquely strategic position to be the supplier of choice to the EV industry, leveraging its low-carbon footprint and market-leading position as North America's largest producer of finished nickel. Nickel sulfate is the chemical compound used in the production of pre-cathode active materials for nickel-based lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a momentous agreement for Vale Base Metals that brings a key partner in GM into this first-of-its-kind facility for Canada and North America," said Vale Executive Vice President of Base Metals, Deshnee Naidoo. "The proposed nickel sulfate project would utilize high purity, low-carbon nickel from our Canadian refineries and is a natural extension for the business, offering diversified sales and a fast entry and anchor point into the North American electric vehicle market. We look forward to continuing engagements with the governments of Canada and Quebec on this strategic critical mineral project."
"GM's dedicated cross-functional organization — including experts from global purchasing and supply chain, corporate development, legal, finance and treasury — is strictly focused on building a secure, sustainable, scalable and cost-competitive EV supply chain," said Doug Parks, GM executive vice president of Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain. "Their work has already allowed GM to sign multiple binding agreements to secure the battery raw material to support 1 million units of annual EV capacity in North America in 2025. This new agreement with Vale reinforces GM's leadership in building a secure and sustainable North America EV supply chain and will provide GM with significant supply of high-grade nickel sulfate from a low-carbon source."
"In addition, Canada continues to play an important role in GM's all-electric future and the material sourced from Vale will help support EV eligibility for consumer incentives under the new clean energy tax credits in the U.S.," said Parks.
Vale and GM have also agreed to study collaborative ways to partner on advanced technology development and commercialization pathways to harvest recycled metals. 
"This announcement between Vale and GM builds on Canada's world-leading EV battery industry," said the Honorable François-Philippe Champagne, Canada's Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry. "It's become even more clear that Canada can be the supplier of choice for the electric cars of the future. By leveraging Canadian critical minerals, we will see more jobs for Canadians, a growing economy and a greener and cleaner future for everyone."
"The signing of this agreement confirms that the biggest players in the industry want to invest here and enter our supply chain. We have the resources and the expertise to produce the cleanest battery in the world, and this news will certainly contribute to that," said Pierre Fitzgibbon, Québec's Minister of Economy, Innovation and Energy, Minister Responsible for Regional Economic Development and Minister Responsible for the Metropolis and the Montréal Region.
Vale S.A.'s  base metals business is one of the world's largest producers of high-quality nickel and an important producer of copper and responsibly sourced cobalt. With headquarters in Toronto, Canada, and operations in Newfoundland & Labrador, Ontario, Manitoba, Indonesia and Brazil, the business delivers critical building blocks for a cleaner, greener future.
General Motors  (NYSE:GM) is a global company focused on advancing an all-electric future that is inclusive and accessible to all. At the heart of this strategy is the Ultium battery platform, which will power everything from mass-market to high-performance vehicles. General Motors, its subsidiaries and its joint venture entities sell vehicles under the Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac, Baojun and Wuling brands.

About LOCOcyte™ Platform Our LOCOcyte™ allogeneic cell-based immunotherapy platform enables potent localized modulation of the immune system which also precipitates a systemic immune response, allowing us to treat previously intractable cancers. The technology leverage three unique advantages:
- Potent immune effector molecules are generated by synthetically engineering allogeneic cells creating a ready-to-use therapy,
- Therapy is localized in proximity to the primary tumor site and generates innate and adaptive immune response, and
- The immunomodulator trains the patient's immune system generating a robust immune response that seeks and eradicates distal metastasis without systemic toxicity.
About Avenge Bio Avenge Bio, Inc. ("Avenge") is an oncology-focused biotechnology company developing transformative cell-based immunotherapeutic products for the treatment of intractable solid tumors by incorporating its LOCOcyte™ platform. The LOCOcyte™ platform leverages proprietary engineered cells delivered to the local tumor environment that generate high concentrations of immune effector molecules in proximity to the tumor. This initiates a robust, local, and durable systemic immune response while avoiding toxicities associated with systemic immunotherapies. Avenge's most advanced product candidate, AVB-001, produces native IL-2 immunotherapy and is initially being studied in metastatic peritoneal cancers such as ovarian cancer. Avenge has additional pipeline candidates for the treatment of a wide range of cancers including pancreatic, lung and breast cancers. Avenge was founded in 2019 base upon technology developed in the laboratory of Omid Veiseh, Ph.D. and has an exclusive license from Rice University for this technology.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn., Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pilot Company is advancing its newly established Team Member Experience (TMX) department forward with the addition of a new key leader: Angie Cody, director of inclusion, diversity and equity. This new leadership position will build on the company's 64-year history of being a premier travel center network and top workplace by creating meaningful, strategic programs that foster a more inclusive environment amongst team members. 
"We're proud to employ nearly 30,000 team members who come from amazingly diverse backgrounds and experiences," said Paul Shore, Chief People Officer of Pilot Company. "Our company's success is driven by the strength of our team, which is why this position is central to delivering an exceptional, inclusive and well-rounded experience."
Angie Cody will oversee and expand upon opportunities to create a more inclusive workplace, joining Pilot Company's TMX department. She will manage current inclusion, diversity, equity and awareness (IDEA) efforts, craft strategic action plans for the advancement of an accessible, equitable and inclusive work environment, and help us increase the company's diversity recruitment pipeline.  Under her leadership, Pilot Company recently launched five new business resource groups – Emerging Leaders, Building Relationships in Diverse Group Environments (BRIDGE), Pride of Pilot, Women of Pilot, and Veterans of Pilot – to help educate and inform diversity change efforts across the company. Cody brings to the company more than a decade of experience in building and leading global inclusion, diversity and equity initiatives, including co-founding the St. Louis Diversity and Inclusion Consortium.
Since joining earlier this summer, Cody has already helped move the needle on improvements to support workforce opportunity, including a new IDEA Council comprised of 15 senior leaders who represent different areas within the business. Those efforts and new implementations have been recognized by the American Trucking Associations, who recently awarded Pilot Company with their DEI Change Leader Award.
"Our company is on a journey to continue advancing the overall team member experience, and DEI is an incredibly important part of that roadmap," said Cody. "Diversity strengthens our company as it expands our horizons and helps us learn from others' perspectives to bring new ideas and initiatives that make Pilot Company a more inclusive and welcoming place to work and shop."
Cody is a United States Marine Corps veteran, graduated from Columbia College with a BA in Finance and is a Certified Diversity Executive (CDE) by the Society for Diversity. She relocated in 2022 to Knoxville, TN from St. Louis, MO with her wife, Becky.

DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Ed Morse Automotive Group announced today it has acquired Destination Daytona, the iconic entertainment complex. The acquisition includes Daytona Harley-Davidson, the Clarion Inn Ormond Beach, Saints & Sinners Pub, the 35,000 square-foot Rock N'Roll event pavilion, plus it will become the proprietor for the numerous on-site tenants. Ed Morse Automotive Group purchased the complex from the Rossmeyer family, and will soon begin selling LiveWire, the electric American motorcycle brand. Destination Daytona is located at 1635 North US Highway 1 in Ormond Beach, Florida.
Destination Daytona is a 100 plus acre entertainment and retail complex that was built around Daytona Harley-Davidson's 109,000 square-foot and two-story showroom. Considered a bucket-list experience for bikers, Destination Daytona is also home to three other restaurants, a condominium, motorcycle museum and numerous popular retail tenants. 
In addition, the purchase will include the Main Street retail store located at 510 Main St. Bridge in Daytona that will be called Teddy Morse's Daytona Harley-Davidson Main St. 
"After our purchase of three Harley-Davidson dealerships and a retail store in Texas recently, we had the opportunity to make this deal in Ormond Beach and it was too exciting to pass up. We loved the fact that this amazing entertainment campus is in our home state and that the Rossmeyer family wanted it to go to another family-owned business," said Teddy Morse, Chairman and CEO of Ed Morse Automotive Group. "We look forward to enhancing and expanding this incredible property."
The Ed Morse Automotive Group is headquartered in Delray Beach, Florida, and has been family-owned for over 75 years. These acquisitions will add nearly 140 employees to its over 2,000 plus employee base. The Ed Morse Automotive Group has grown to 36 dealerships, 70 franchises, 40 locations, and 18 automotive and motorcycle brands.
About Ed Morse Automotive Group The Morse family has been in the automotive business since 1946 when Ed Morse founded Morse Motors. Over 75 years later, Ed's grandson, Chairman/CEO Teddy Morse continues to build on the legacy and family tradition. Headquartered in Delray Beach, Florida and with recent acquisitions into Texas, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois and Oklahoma, Ed Morse Automotive Group is considered to be one of the nation's fastest growing and most respected automotive dealer groups. www.edmorse.com

New integration facilitates hardware repairs and spare device management for K-12 districts
ATLANTA, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Lexicon Tech Solutions, a leader in the Southeast for device repair and maintenance for K-12 districts, released an API-driven integration to allow K-12 IT teams to  track Lexicon's AlwaysLearning™ spare pool management and device-repair workflows directly from the Incident IQ platform.
"The big win for districts is they can create repairs and track tickets without having to toggle between two systems." Lexicon's AlwaysLearning service guarantees zero downtime for students, even while devices are undergoing repair. AlwaysLearning contracts include spare pool management and unlimited accidental damage protection (ADP). Once repairs are initiated, the average turn time is under seven days.
With the integration, K-12 IT teams initiate repair requests directly from an Incident IQ help ticket. Lexicon is notified of the damaged device, picks-up the device, and begins repairs. IT technicians monitor repair status and spare pool inventories from within iiQ.
"The big win for districts is they can create repairs and track tickets without having to toggle between two systems," said Josh King, Lexicon Tech Solutions CEO.
The two companies worked closely on the integration with the goal of keeping the process simple and streamlined.
"Minimizing device downtime is critical for making sure that today's technology-transformed classrooms stay focused on teaching and learning," said Jorgen von Tangen, VP of Apps & Integrations at Incident IQ. "By combining Incident IQ and Lexicon's support solutions, K-12 districts are covered the moment a device is damaged, and they remain informed throughout every step of the repair process. This partnership saves K-12 teams valuable time and helps them get the most out of their technology budgets."
The AlwaysLearning integration is available for Incident IQ user districts with a Lexicon Tech AlwaysLearning™ service contract.
About LEXICON TECH SOLUTIONS Lexicon provides device repair and maintenance services to K-12 districts of all sizes. The AlwaysLearning™ device management program leads the industry in turn times and repair rates.
About Incident IQ Incident IQ is the workflow management platform built exclusively for K-12 schools, featuring asset management, help ticketing, facilities maintenance solutions, and more.

CHERRY HILL, N.J., Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- TD Bank, America's Most Convenient Bank ® , announced today the results of its 2022 Merry Money Survey, which found that consumers' concerns around inflation are driving many to take even greater proactive steps to ensure they don't overspend this holiday season. In fact, 57% said they are creating a holiday-specific budget this year as a result of inflation and rising prices.
TD polled 1,000+ Americans about their shopping, spending and money management habits during the holiday season. The survey found that the economic environment is weighing heavily on consumers' minds, with 74% of respondents saying the financial aspect of the holiday season makes them anxious, compared to 66% who said the same in 2021. Despite this, 82% of consumers remain confident in their ability to manage their spending.
"The continuing rise of inflation has added a tremendous level of anxiety and stress to many Americans, and it's understandable that this could impact how consumers decide to spend this holiday season compared to previous years," said Matt Boss, Head of Consumer Products at TD Bank. "It's important that consumers are in control of their finances, not only during the holiday season, but year-round. The fundamental practice of having and maintaining an accurate budget can help them gain the confidence to maximize their spending goals and behaviors."  
Budget now, thank yourself later
Sixty-nine percent of consumers admit they have previously overspent during past holidays, of which 45% said they overspent by $300 or more. For many, the pressure to find the right gift for loved ones (36%) and the impulse to take advantage of holiday sales (26%) topped the list of contributing factors in overspending.
Despite past behaviors, over spenders are conscious of their future shopping habits. Ninety-two percent said they have considered adjusting their future holiday spending habits to avoid overspending – including spending less on gifts, sticking to a budget, gifting to fewer loved ones this year and more.
Dashing through the payment options
Payments are like gift boxes; one size doesn't fit all. When asked how they intend to pay for holiday purchases, more than four in ten consumers (42%) cited debit cards as their primary payment method, followed by credit cards (33%).
A whopping 76% of those using bank or store credit cards also noted that they do so to earn rewards or cash back on their spending. When it comes to paying off holiday bills, nearly two-thirds of respondents who use credit cards or personal loans for holiday spending expect to pay 100% of their outstanding balance in January 2023.
"All financial situations require unique approaches that strike the right balance between saving and spending," said Boss. "For example, for those consumers who might be looking to take advantage of incentives and cash back for their holiday purchases, you might elect to use rewards or store credit cards. No matter how you choose to spend, it's more important to spend within your means and have a plan to responsibly manage those expenses."
The gift that keeps on giving – healthy financial habits
Beyond the holidays, shoppers are also prioritizing and setting themselves up for success in 2023, including:
- Getting a receipt, checking it twice: Ninety percent said they review their spending throughout the holiday season, and nearly half of respondents (46%) said they do it every time they make a purchase.
- Prepping ahead instead: Fifty-three percent of consumers said they set aside cash throughout the year for holiday spending by stashing money in a separate jar, utilizing a separate bank account or saving gift cards and reward points for use during the holidays.
- Gathering advice, making it nice: Family is the top source for financial advice (30%) during the holiday season, with friends following closely at 20%. Fourteen percent of consumers look to online resources and tutorials. If you're not sure where to start online, make the most of your merry money with a free tool, like TD Bank Learning Center. And of course, consumers can also join the 10% of survey respondents who seek advice from financial professionals.

Methodology
Big Village surveyed 1,006 Americans 18 years of age and older who celebrate the holidays. The online survey was conducted October 18-23, 2022.

Full text: SALT LAKE CITY, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- In late 2021, rPlus Energies sold its interest in the approximately 152 MW "Cedar Creek Wind" project to Clearway Energy Group ("Clearway"). This announcement follows Clearway's recent statement that it has signed a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) between Cedar Creek Wind and PacifiCorp. The signing of the PPA marks a major step forward for the project, which was originally developed by rPlus Energies, and is now slated to be completed in 2024.
rPlus Energies acquired development rights from the originators of Cedar Creek Wind in early 2019. The project is located in Bingham County, Idaho outside of Idaho Falls, an area familiar to wind development. Between Cedar Creek's original concept and 2019, wind turbine technology had advanced significantly, enabling the greater extraction of energy and overall viability of the project. rPlus saw the opportunity to reinvigorate development efforts, and over the course of 18 months, essentially re-developed Cedar Creek Wind including new land agreements, environmental studies, permits, interconnection and modernized design.
With a revamped project, rPlus submitted a bid into PacifiCorp's 2020 All-Source Request for Proposals (RFP) which was subsequently shortlisted and awarded through a competitive process. Then, in late 2021, rPlus sold Cedar Creek Wind to Clearway, who finalized the development, engineering, and equipment procurement and executed the PPA with PacifiCorp.
Clearway began construction in September 2022, and the project is expected to create more than 175 jobs during construction and represents a $250 million investment in Idaho's economy.

Full text: BNPL, digital wallets, and eCommerce rise as consumers fill their carts  
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- A seamless payments experience is essential for most consumers. It drives payment choice at checkout just as much or even more than getting a good deal, according to a new survey conducted by TSG (The Strawhecker Group) and the Electronic Transactions Association (ETA). View the infographic here.
"New payment methods are changing consumer behavior and the adoption of payment technology," stated Jodie Kelley, CEO of ETA. "The survey found that when it comes to adopting new payments technology, ease of use is most important."  
"Despite inflationary concerns, savvy consumers are still filling their carts and gaining confidence in newer payment technologies like digital wallets and buy now, pay later," said Mike Strawhecker, President of TSG. "The payments industry continues to provide merchants with solutions for new consumer experiences." 
Ease of payments technology drives consumer behavior.   Since last year's survey, frequent users of digital wallets have grown (21 percent versus 17 percent). While the number of regular users of 1-click accounts has remained the same year-over-year, more consumers have tried using them (67 percent vs. 65 percent). 
Consumers are split evenly between payment options that are easiest to use, the one that gives them the best deal, and the most secure one.  
- The survey found that more consumers are adopting digital wallets as a standard payment method, and 42 percent of digital wallet users said they were at least 'somewhat confident' leaving the house without their physical wallet.
- Gen Z and young millennials care more about seamless experiences (49 percent and 41 percent compared to 35 percent). In contrast, older millennials (ages 35 – 44) care more about saving the most money (31 percent compared to 27 percent).

Most consumers (62 percent) plan on shopping online and in-store.  
- Consumers who made more than $100k a year report that they expected to do 61 percent of their shopping online (a 6-pt increase from 2021).

Concerns over inflation mean savvier consumers.   The survey found that consumers will utilize buy now, pay later (BNPL) to help manage their budgets.  
- Twenty percent of consumers said there were planning on using BNPL during the holiday season, and another 20 percent were on the fence.
- When promoting adoption, overcoming the initial barrier to entry matters for BNPL companies, as those who previously tried BNPL were 38 percent more likely to use it this holiday season than consumers who had never attempted BNPL.

While most consumers plan on spending about the same as they did last year (37 percent), overall sentiment towards holiday spending is down.  
- Consumers will be savvier and look for ways to save money this holiday season. At the time of this survey, 62 percent said they were concerned about 'getting the best deal' on their purchases, and 66 percent were concerned about managing their budget.

Full text: Alyson Fouse serves as showrunner; premieres spring 2023
ATLANTA , Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Bounce, the popular broadcast and multi-platform entertainment network serving African Americans, today announced a partnership with MGM to produce a new original series, "Act Your Age."
The multiple-camera, half-hour comedy tells the story of three vibrant, successful Washington D.C./Northern Virginia-area women in their 50's who are each at a personal crossroads and who decide the best way forward in life is together. "Act Your Age" stars Kym Whitley ("Curb Your Enthusiasm," "Next Friday," "Young and Hungry") and Tisha Campbell ("Uncoupled," "My Wife and Kids," "Dr. Ken") with special guest star Yvette Nicole Brown ("Community," "The Mayor," "Big Shot").
Whitley plays Bernadette, a successful, no-nonsense real estate developer. Campbell plays Keisha, the wild card of the group who is always up to something, and Brown plays Angela, the former First Lady of Norfolk, Virginia, who is looking to redefine her life after being widowed by her husband, a revered career politician.
The multi-generational sitcom also features Mariah Robinson ("The Wrong Valentine") and Nathan Anderson ("All About the Washingtons," "Richie Rich,") as the 20-something children of Angela and Bernadette, respectively.
Alyson Fouse ("Big Shot," "Everybody Hates Chris," "The Wanda Sykes Show") created the series and serves as showrunner and executive producer. The series is produced by Mark Burnett, Barry Poznick and Bradley Gardner ("Hot in Cleveland") and co-executive producer Ken Ornstein ("Everybody Loves Raymond").
The 16-episode first season of "Act Your Age" has begun production in Los Angeles and will premiere on Bounce in the spring of 2023.
"The opportunity to do 'Act Your Age' with Kym, Tisha and Yvette on Bounce, a network that has made me feel so comfortable being my authentic self, means the world to me," said Fouse. "We've built a world where the stories of Black women in the prime of their lives can be both funny and heartfelt; a world where individually they shine but they also show support for one another. 'Act Your Age' is a celebration of the Black women who have loved, raised, befriended and held me up through the years and it honors and salutes the ones who have inspired me."
"Partnering with MGM Television, working with top showrunner Alyson Fouse, and attracting immensely popular and talented actors Kym Whitley, Tisha Campbell and Yvette Nicole Brown are game-changing and huge steps forward for Bounce originals," said David Hudson, vice president of original programming, Scripps Networks.
"Act Your Age" is the newest Bounce original series, joining "Johnson," the critically acclaimed hit show focusing on four lifelong best friends, and "Finding Happy," starring B. Simone as a mid-30s woman determined to change her life for the better. Both of these shows come from Eric C. Rhone's & Cedric The Entertainer's production company, A Bird And A Bear Entertainment.

- Available now across Saskatchewan and while supplies last, Tim Hortons hot beverage cups and lids are going grey to get fans excited for this weekend's CFL celebrations.
- Serving hot beverages with the grey lids is the latest step in the Tim Hortons Tims for Good sustainability journey to improve our packaging. The grey lids represent the first time we've developed a hot beverage lid that's made with 25 per cent post-consumer recycled material. The grey lids are made from polypropylene, a material that is recyclable, similar to our white hot beverage lids that are also recyclable.
- Fans will be able to visit the Tims for Good coffee truck at the 109 th Grey Cup and enjoy coffee or hot chocolate in grey cups while cheering for the Toronto Argonauts or Winnipeg Blue Bombers.

REGINA, SK , Nov. 17, 2022 /CNW/ - Available now across Saskatchewan and while supplies last, Tim Hortons is turning its iconic red cups grey in celebration of the 109 th Grey Cup being held this Sunday, Nov. 20 in Regina. Tim Hortons guests across the province will also receive their favourite hot beverages with a specially designed grey lid, which is made with 25 per cent post-consumer recycled polypropylene – a first for Tim Hortons. The grey lids are also recyclable, like our standard white hot beverage lids.
"Building on our theme of serving hot beverages in grey cups for the Grey Cup we wanted to take the idea one step further – by leaning into our Tims for Good sustainability platform," says Paul Yang, Senior Director of Procurement, Sustainability and Packaging at Tim Hortons.
"When we changed the colour of our hot beverage lids to white, we did so with an aim of improving the value of the materials to recyclers and to enable more options for repurposing these materials. By developing these grey lids with 25 per cent post-consumer recycled polypropylene – which gives the lids their grey colouring – we can use the learnings from this limited-time event to continue to develop and advance circular packaging solutions for all our guests across Canada."
Canadian Football League fans will be able to visit the Tims for Good coffee truck at the 109 th Grey Cup and enjoy coffee or hot chocolate in the grey cups while cheering along the Toronto Argonauts or Winnipeg Blue Bombers .
The limited-edition grey cups and lids are available at participating restaurants across Saskatchewan while supplies last.

New report assesses the net-zero readiness of 50 cities, with four Canadian municipalities ranking as global 'pacesetters'
TORONTO, Nov. 17, 2022 /CNW/ - Responsible for more than 70 per cent of the world's annual carbon emissions, cities must lead the way if we are to win the fight against climate change, finds a new in-depth Net-Zero Readiness Spotlight report by KPMG International.
"The way we design, build and operate our cities will determine whether we win or lose the climate change battle," says Eric Wolfe, Infrastructure Partner and Cities Lead, KPMG in Canada. "Cities have a greater capacity than they even realize to accelerate the transition to a greener and more sustainable future. The key is to look beyond simple measures that they directly control and understand how their decisions drive all emissions produced within their communities. This will require mayors and councils to be bold, resolute, and think differently."
The KPMG report, in collaboration with United Cities, evaluates the status and progress of 50 cities in the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) across the five biggest emission sectors – energy, mobility and connectivity, built environment, industry, and waste and sanitation. Over half of the cities are capitals and include coastal, landlocked, and small island urban areas.
Using a rigorous, weighted methodology, KPMG assessed each city on 48 key "green" globally recognized indicators, such as per capita GHG emissions, greenspace per capita, green building ratings, electric vehicle transport, circular economy incentives, food waste, public transportation, and use of smart water meters.
The cities were grouped into "pacesetters" and "followers". Pacesetter cities have been able to move towards net zero by taking steps to decarbonize in each of the five sectors. Some of the followers are megacities with very large and growing populations, rampant urban sprawl, and limited public transport. They typically rely on policies that are counterproductive to fighting climate change, such as low-density suburban developments and fossil fuel subsidies.
In Canada, Montreal, Toronto, Quebec City, and Vancouver were among the pacesetting cities, although each are at various stages of their net-zero transition journey with much still to accomplish, says Mr. Wolfe.
Buildings and homes are the third-largest source of GHG emissions in Canada behind the oil and gas and transportation sectors, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada.
"Achieving net zero at a neighbourhood or community scale is as important as top-down approaches that cities have in place," says Stephen Beatty, Global Head of Infrastructure and Head, Global Cities Centre of Excellence, KPMG International, and Partner, KPMG in Canada. "Policies, projects, and initiatives can be tested at the local level and used to trial innovative approaches to mitigate climate change risks, engage participation of citizens, and create a sense of collaborative ownership in the transition to net zero."
"It's about embedding net zero in how cities decide on everything from density, public transport, energy sources, new buildings, retrofitting old buildings and green spaces to waste and water management," he says. "With carbon emissions in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, for example, on track to reach pre-pandemic levels of carbon emissions, it's imperative that cities review, consider, and implement policies from a sustainability lens."
The KPMG report notes that some cities, like Barcelona, are leveraging digital twin technologies to test, measure and track the impact of their decarbonization plans and strategies. Using digital twins, KPMG can create virtual versions of the urban environment and leverage artificial intelligence to help cities visualize the impact of climate change and identify options and inform their climate actions.
"We hope to spur the kind of dialogue and debate cities should be having about climate finance, climate equity, and a just transition towards net zero," says Mr. Beatty. "The more cities can assess, monitor, and evaluate the impact of their climate action plans, the more likely they are to access climate finance and win public support."

- Dot won the Best of Innovation award in the "Accessibility" category at CES 2023.
- Dot was named as an honoree in three categories after being nominated as the finalist
in each.
- As of November 2022, the startup had secured KRW 25 billion in total cumulative investment and obtained 130 patents in Korea and overseas.

SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Dot (co-founders: Eric Ju Yoon Kim and Ki Kwang Sung), a member of the Born2Global Centre (CEO Kim Jong-kap), and a startup that develops devices and software for the visually impaired, announced November 17 that its "Dot Pad" won the Best of Innovation award in the "Accessibility" category at CES 2023. Dot became the 15th certified B Corp in Korea four years ago, joining the ranks of other global heart-forward companies and further fortifying its aspirations toward increasing accessibility for the visually impaired.
The Dot Pad was nominated as the finalist in three categories—Accessibility, Mobile & Devices, and Virtual & Augmented Reality—and awarded in all three. 
The CES Innovation Award, granted by the National Consumer Technology Association (CTA), is conferred for innovative technologies and products that are expected to lead the world and is viewed as the highest honor of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES).
Since its founding in 2015, Dot has developed various assistive devices using its independently developed core technology, "Dot Cell," and introduced the world's first tactile display, the Dot Pad, in 2021. The Dot Pad consists of 2,400 pins arranged in a pixel-like grid that can quickly be set in up or down positions, reproducing letters in braille or easily identifiable shapes, symbols, tables, or charts stored on PCs or mobile devices. To recognize the image displayed on the Dot Pad, the user simply needs to touch it with his or her fingers. The device is expected to increase accessibility for the visually impaired in various areas of daily life such as education, music, and entertainment.
Dot collaborated with Apple to have the Dot Pad update included in the iOS 15.2 update last December. Now, the Dot Pad integrates directly into Apple's VoiceOver screen reading feature, enabling visually impaired users of iPhones or iPads to read text, icon labels, and even graphs or simple images with just a simple touch. Besides Apple, Dot is working on innovative projects with companies, organizations, and research institutes around the world. 
Dot co-founders Eric Ju Yoon Kim and Ki Kwang Sung said, "We are grateful that the value of the world's first tactile display has been recognized worldwide, and we hope this will serve as an opportunity to bring more attention to education for the blind and the work environment around the world."
Meanwhile, Dot is working closely with American Printing House(APH) and Humanware in education for the visually impaired in the United States through their unique technology. They are ultimately aiming to help rehabilitate people with acquired visual impairment and increase work productivity by facilitating access to essential office programs such as Excel and PowerPoint in the workplace through collaboration with Apple and NV ACCESS. Dot's continuous research is expected to change the education and work environment of the visually impaired around the world.
Dot  
Founded in 2015, Dot has commercialized products such as the Dot Watch, Dot Pad, and Dot Kiosk. The company has focused its business on the "social" component of ESG and introduced innovative solutions to social problems through its technological advancements in domestic and overseas markets. As of November 2022, Dot has attracted KRW 25 billion in Series B investment and acquired 130 patents in Korea and overseas.

Full text: Thirdera, the largest pure-play ServiceNow partner, together with VividCharts, maker of the premier ServiceNow native reporting platform, today announced the availability of integrated ServiceNow solution packages that include full scope consulting, implementation, and key measurement tracking and reporting.
LEXINGTON, Ky., Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Today, 97% of ServiceNow's customers are extracting data out of the platform for reporting purposes. This greatly diminishes the power of ServiceNow by putting broader user adoption, data security and governance, as well as the overall effectiveness of work management in the platform at risk.

Full text: - Acquisition expected to strengthen service capabilities of PTC's closed-loop PLM portfolio
- PTC's manufacturing customers rely on field service management for product performance, customer satisfaction, and profitability expansion
- Strong synergies between PTC and ServiceMax's manufacturing customers and product portfolios
- Transaction expected to be accretive to PTC's SaaS ARR and cash flow in FY'23

BOSTON, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- PTC (NASDAQ: PTC) today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire ServiceMax for approximately $1.46 billion in cash on a debt-free, cash-free basis from an entity majority owned by Silver Lake. ServiceMax is a recognized leader in cloud-native, product-centric field service management (FSM) software. The acquisition is expected to strengthen PTC's closed-loop product lifecycle management (PLM) offerings by extending the digital thread of product information into downstream enterprise asset management (EAM) and FSM capabilities. Subject to the satisfaction of regulatory approval and other applicable closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close in early January 2023.
"The addition of ServiceMax will realize a key part of PTC's closed-loop PLM strategy," said Jim Heppelmann, President and CEO, PTC. "The PLM capabilities PTC has long offered to engineering and manufacturing departments provide the system of record for the digital definition of any product configuration. ServiceMax will complement this by providing the system of record for monitoring and servicing product instances after they leave the factory and move into customer use. Upon completion of this acquisition, PTC will have the unique ability to complement the full digital product definition from our computer-aided design (CAD) and PLM solutions with detailed usage information from our internet of things (IoT) solutions and the complete service history from ServiceMax. PTC is poised to be the only company that will be able to offer manufacturers this comprehensive view of their products at each stage of the lifecycle."
"ServiceMax and PTC have a longstanding relationship rooted in the common profile of our customers, the natural synergies of our products, and a shared understanding of the importance of product data at different stages of the lifecycle," said Neil Barua, CEO, ServiceMax. "PTC has a strong and consistent track record of success, and now following the growth and innovation we've achieved during our partnership with Silver Lake, we're excited for the ServiceMax team to strengthen the service offerings of PTC's digital thread and closed-loop PLM portfolio."
Partners since 2015, PTC and ServiceMax both support manufacturers of complex, highly configured products for the medical device, industrial products, aerospace, and related verticals. These manufacturers view field service as a strategic part of their businesses to maintain product performance, extend their products' lifecycles, increase customer satisfaction, drive revenue growth, and expand profitability.
ServiceMax provides a comprehensive suite of cloud-native FSM capabilities built on the Salesforce platform. These capabilities include managing all relevant information about serviced products – product description, serial number, service history, and more – creating and managing work orders, and scheduling and dispatching technicians. ServiceMax's FSM capabilities are also closely integrated with Salesforce's customer relationship management (CRM) system, which bridges a deep understanding of the product with an equally deep understanding of the customer.
ServiceMax's FSM capabilities will complement PTC's entire digital thread portfolio: leveraging product definition data from PTC's Creo ® and Windchill ® solutions, technical publishing capabilities from PTC's Arbortext ® software, service parts management capabilities from PTC's Servigistics ® software, IoT and digital twin capabilities from PTC's ThingWorx ® solutions, and augmented reality (AR) capabilities from PTC's Vuforia ® software. For example, by remotely monitoring connected products with ThingWorx, customers could proactively detect service needs and automatically generate service orders in ServiceMax. Service technicians could leverage 2D work instructions from Arbortext or 3D AR work instructions created in Vuforia that are derived from the product's digital product definition information created in Creo and managed in Windchill. Technicians could also leverage a more detailed understanding of service activities to better optimize spare parts inventory with Servigistics.
Transaction Details and Financial Impact
The purchase price will be funded in two stages, with $808 million paid at closing and $650 million paid in October 2023. The transaction will be funded with cash on hand, borrowings under PTC's existing credit facility, and a new $500 million committed term loan.
ServiceMax is expected to contribute approximately $160 million in ARR for PTC's Q2'23.
The transaction is expected to be accretive to PTC's FY'23 cash flow from operations, free cash flow, and adjusted free cash flow targets.
