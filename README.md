# data-science-4-social-issues
In my Data Science for Economic and Social Issues course at A&amp;M, I completed a project analyzing the relationship between stock price and news sentiment. 

This project was completed in a group setting. We first selected top companies by market cap and by the number of articles available for each company. Next, some group members were charged with downloading years' worth of news article data relating to these companies from the ProQuest database, while other group members downloaded stock price data for these companies over the same timeframe from Yahoo Finance. 

One other student and I were entrusted with performing the data preprocessing and analysis. 

We began by cleaning the data - pruning the news and stock datasets to the important columns and merging the datasets together. We then visualized the data in a variety of ways and created neural networks to try and capture the relationship (if one existed) between news sentiment and stock price, then reported the results of our analysis.

Finally, another group of students condensed our findings into a report.
